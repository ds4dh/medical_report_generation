The Detectability Paradox: Bilingual Medical Report Generation with Open-Weight Models and the Limits of Human Oversight

## Introduction
This project investigates the quality and safety risks of using large language models (LLMs) to automate medical report generation in both English and French. We evaluate reports from several multilingual LLMs using both automated metrics and a medical expert panel, demonstrating high-quality output while highlighting the critical need for automated tools to detect machine-generated content.
