CR_ENG_1,English,"We present here a case of a 21-year-old right-handed Romanian male, who was working in the United States on an employer-sponsored visa and presented to the emergency department of Atlantic Regional Medical Center in Atlantic City, New Jersey, with acute episodes of vomiting, diplopia, and ataxic gait and two episodes of tonic-clonic seizures. The patient was brought in by his acquaintances who reported headaches for two weeks along with vision changes and a slow decline in his mentation. His friends stated that the patient was becoming more tired and lethargic with a waxing and waning in mentation. Pertinent physical exam revealed Parinaud's syndrome with upward gaze palsy, diplopia, and unsteady gait. A CT scan was done in the emergency department that showed a pineal mass of 3 × 3 × 3.5 mm in size along with obstructive hydrocephalus and dilatation of lateral and third ventricles without any evidence of bleeding. The patient also had an episode of seizure in the emergency department and was administered a loading dose of Keppra 1000 mg and a maintenance dose of 500 mg twice a day intravenously. The patient was then admitted to the neurological critical care unit for further monitoring.
Neurosurgery evaluated the patient and recommended to bolus 10 mg of IV dexamethasone and with the maintenance of 4 mg IV every 6 hours to prevent expansion and reduction of the cytotoxic edema from the mass effect. Given his symptoms of obstructive hydrocephalus with increased ICP of 22 mmHg, an endoscopic ventricular drain was placed for the drainage to relieve the pressure by the neurosurgeon. MRI of the brain revealed a pineal mass causing obstructive hydrocephalus via the compression of the cerebral aqueduct likely from a possible underlying intracranial germ cell tumor (, image R to L). MRI of the cervical, thoracic, and lumbar spine was done with and without contrast. No enhancing lesions were visualized on these images, and there was no evidence of drop metastasis or discrete mass lesion or pathologic enhancement in the spinal system (). A detailed MRI of the lesion revealed mass arising from the pineal gland with a diameter of 3.6 cm and predominantly solid component with discrete calcification inside the mass (Figures –). The tumor was causing compression of the tectal plate of the midbrain and subjacent aqueduct, which was resulting in obstructive hydrocephalus. To further evaluate, we obtained serum beta-hCG and alpha-fetoprotein to distinguish if the mass was a pure extragonadal germ cell tumor or NGGCT. Patient's serum alpha-fetoprotein levels were elevated to 215.8 ng/mL (normal range of 0-8 ng/mL), and beta-hCG level was noted to be 35 mIU/mL (normal range of 0-3 mIU/mL). Given the elevations of the tumor markers, this patient likely had an NGGCT; however, a definite diagnosis biopsy was needed. On day three of his admission, the patient received an endoscopic third ventriculostomy to improve the obstructive hydrocephalus and help in the drainage of the cerebrospinal fluid through the cerebral aqueduct system during which we also obtained a biopsy of the sample ().
However, after this procedure, the patient developed a transient episode of central diabetes insipidus. On his laboratory analysis, he was noted to have sodium level of 145 mEq/L (range 135 mEq/L-145 mEq/L) with a urine osmolality of 161 and serum osmolality of 298. Central diabetes insipidus is defined as serum sodium concentration higher than 142 mEq/L in a setting of polyuria of 3000 cc/day with a plasma osmolality of 295 and a low urine osmolality, which were all noted in this patient. This was a complication likely from the EVT procedure. The patient was observed to be in transient triphasic response with the polyuric phase for five days, followed by an antidiuretic phase of 6 more days. We monitored his urine output very closely replacing cc per cc of volume by giving him by mouth and isotonic IV fluids. The patient was started on desmopressin, which was administered in the intravenous form initially and then converted to intranasal.
The patient subsequently developed hyponatremia likely also contributed from the desmopressin, and he was noted to develop cerebral salt wasting for which he was placed on hydrocortisone and later changed to fludrocortisone. Patient's urine output decreased at a goal less than 3 L in 24 hours with a normal serum osmolality. Pathology report came back, which revealed atypical cells were forming glandular architecture and solid area, which are all positive for Sal-4 and negative for CD30 and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) (). The atypical glands are positive for pancytokeratin and glypican-3, and the solid area is positive for OCT3/4 and CK117 (). These findings supported a diagnosis of mixed germ cell tumor with yolk sac carcinoma. However, due to the limited material, other components cannot be ruled out. Patient's electrolytes were normalized, and he was medically cleared to travel back to Romania where he would be following up with neurosurgery for further management of his NGGCT.","

CR_ENG_2,English,"A 48-year-old male, construction worker, with a medical history of high blood pressure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, and osteonecrosis of the right femoral head was referred for shoulder consultation due to progressive left shoulder pain associated with stiffness and loss of function. On physical examination, he presented 120° of forward elevation, 10° of external rotation and internal rotation to L5, pain on passive and active mobilization, and 46 points in the Constant score. Plain radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the left shoulder showed a collapse of the humeral head (stage III according to Cruess classification []) with a large osteophyte in the lower region and the characteristic crescent sign ()—imaging findings consistent with OHH. Rotator cuff rupture was not objectified.
Based on age, level of activity (hard manual labour), and integrity of the rotator cuff, the patient underwent an HSA with a PyC head (Aequalis Ascend™ Flex, Tornier). The surgery was performed using a deltopectoral approach in the beach chair position. The subscapular tendon was detached using the “peeling” technique. The anatomical resection of the head was performed with the help of a cutting guide. A PyC head 48 mm × 18 mm (off-set 1.5 mm) with a 5C noncemented humeral short stem that was implanted. Intraoperatively, no acute or chronic lesions were detected in the glenoid cartilage. At the end of the procedure, a full range of motion was confirmed.
The patient followed the standard rehabilitation protocol of our service with 4 weeks of immobilization and 6 months of physiotherapy. Patient was observed for follow-up after 15 days, 6 weeks, 3 months, 1 year, and then at yearly intervals.

CR_ENG_3,English,"Patient 4. A 57-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with a complaint of acute vision loss in both eyes occurring within the previous 10 days. She was primarily diagnosed with ophthalmoneuromyelitis and was admitted to the neurology department for further treatment. On admission, her temperature was 36.5°C, pulse was 76 bpm, respiratory rate was 20/min, and BP was 148/102 mmHg. She was administered with neurotrophic factors and methylprednisolone. On the 2nd day of hospitalization, the patient's BP started to fluctuate between 210/110 and 90/60 mmHg (). Further enhanced abdominal CT imaging revealed a high-density tumor measuring 2.6 cm × 2.8 cm in the left adrenal region (). Laboratory tests revealed an increased catecholamine metabolite level (urinary VMA, 65.2 μmol/24 h; urinary epinephrine, 334.0 μg/24 h; urinary norepinephrine: 212.8 μg/24 h, ). Based on patient's abnormal vital signs (BP variation, fever and tachycardia), elevated urine catecholamine metabolite and CT test result, she was diagnosed with PHEOs (, ).
The patient was transferred to the cardiovascular department for BP management. On the 14th day her BP began to variate between 240/120 and 60/40. She suffered from severe headache and body temperature reached 39.5°C, suggesting signs of PMC. Without using phentolamine, she was directly treated with chlorpromazine (25 mg i.m. followed by 3–4 mg/h continuous infusion, ). Glucose saline was also infused for volume expansion. Subsequently, BP fluctuation abated and gradually stabilized between 100/60 and 120/80 mmHg in the next 3 days (). The operation was successful with no complications, and the BP stabilized around 110–120/60–70 mmHg. Her plasma catecholamine metabolite levels returned to normal levels following treatment (metanephrine: <0.07 nmol/L; normetanephrine: 0.22 nmol/L, ).

CR_ENG_4,English,"An 85-year-old woman with a four-year history of polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis diagnosed per biopsy six months prior to presentation with an acute sensation of neck tightness with radiation to her bilateral shoulders and the epigastrium. Past medical history was significant for atrial fibrillation status following ablation, coronary artery disease status following remote myocardial infarction medically managed, hyperlipidemia, and hypertension. Her home medications included atenolol, coumadin, and prednisone 20 mg PO twice daily. She had intermittently received several rapidly tapered oral steroid courses over the preceding two years for polymyalgia rheumatica and temporal arteritis flares with resolution of clinical symptoms and normalization of acute inflammatory markers.
At admission, her vital signs and cardiopulmonary exam were within normal limits. An electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm with first-degree atrioventricular block. Cardiac biomarkers and a chest radiograph were unremarkable. Labs were significant for a stable known normochromic normocytic anemia of chronic disease (hemoglobin 10.3 g/dL), indolent chronic lymphocytic leukemia (white blood cell count of 11,400), an international normalized ratio of 2.0, and an erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 49 mm/hr. A transthoracic echocardiogram eight months prior to admission demonstrated hyperdynamic left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 65%–70%, mild aortic insufficiency, and mild concentric left ventricular hypertrophy.
Within several hours of admission, the patient was found to be unresponsive and progressively bradycardic with a depressed left ventricular function with ejection fraction of 45%. She later developed a wide complex tachycardia before terminating in pulseless electrical activity.
Subsequent autopsy showed extensive granulomatous inflammation with lymphocytes, giant cells, and elastic membrane destruction in the aorta and vertebrobasilar and coronary arteries. There was evidence of early aortic root and proximal segment dissection without aneurysmal dilatation, associated with a mild pericardial effusion and a left hemothorax. Despite mild, nonobstructive atherosclerosis, there was no evidence of coronary artery occlusion or myocardial focal ischemic changes. Additionally, no large artery stenosis was appreciated.","

CR_ENG_5,English,"A 62-year-old female patient was admitted for discomfort in the upper abdominal area as the chief complaint. The patient visited at “S” hospital for the symptom and diagnosed as cholangiocarcinoma. Although laparoscopic resection was attempted, surgery could not be performed because of the presence of peritoneal seeding. Then she was treated with 1cycle of gemcitabine and cisplatin combination chemotherapy (gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8, cisplatin 60 mg/m2 Day 1, every 3 weeks), and transferred to our hospital. At the time of admission, vital signs were within normal ranges. In peripheral blood test, leukocyte was 4920/μL, hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dL, and platelet was 359,000/μL. In serum biochemistry test, they were also within normal ranges. At the time of admission, tumor marker tests were not performed.
After 2nd cycle of combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin, we performed abdominal computed tomography (CT) for the response evaluation. The abdominal CT revealed that the size of tumor increased as compare to baseline CT findings. For the next therapeutic plan, we performed immunohistochemical staining for TP with a surgical biopsy specimen, and the result, as shown in Figure , was positive immunohistochemical staining for TP.
Afterward, chemotherapeutic agents were switched to gemcitabine and doxifluridine regimen (gemcitabine 1200 mg/m2 Day 1 and 8, doxifluridine 1200 mg divided 3 times p.o. daily, every 3 weeks), and administered 4 cycles. The abdominal CT scan revealed that shrinkage of main mass indicating partial response (Figure ). The patient chose to terminate chemotherapy, and was observed at the outpatient clinic even though the adverse events were minimal. The CT scan performed during the follow-up revealed the progression of disease (remission duration: 9 months), and then combination chemotherapy was restarted with the previous gemcitabine and doxifluridine regimen. The abdominal CT scan performed after 2 cycle of chemotherapy showed the disease progression. Afterward, maintained with doxifluridine alone until the patient's condition was deteriorated and the patient died of sepsis (overall survival: 22 months).","

CR_ENG_7,English,"A 39-year-old female patient with complaints of the loose tooth and swollen gums in the upper front tooth region associated with difficulty while mastication reported to the Department of Periodontics. On examination, Grade III mobility with a probing pocket depth of >10 mm and suppuration was observed in relation to the maxillary right central incisor []. Orthopantomogram (OPG) revealed an extensive bone loss in relation to 11, suggesting a hopeless prognosis []. Both clinical and radiographic examination indicated an extraction of 11. Scaling and root planing was done and the patient was recalled after 1 week for extraction of 11 as the patient was not willing for any endodontic treatment. Before the procedure, the position of the tooth in the arch and its relationship with the adjacent teeth was evaluated. Atraumatic extraction of the tooth was done under local anesthesia. The extraction socket was curetted and irrigated with antiseptic povidone-iodine to remove the granulation tissue []. Care was taken to remove the granulation tissue completely and to create fresh bleeding in the socket. Five milliliter venous blood was collected from the antecubital fossa, platelet-rich fibrin (PRF) membrane was prepared using a centrifuge machine, and this membrane was placed in the extraction socket [].
The extracted tooth was cleansed using an ultrasonic scaler to remove any surface debris and adherent granulation tissue. The root portion of the tooth was reduced using airotor to the desired length []. An access cavity was prepared, and all the pulpal remnants were removed and irrigated using a sodium hypochlorite solution. Then, the orifice was closed with composite resin. At the cervical region of the extracted tooth modified ridge lap pontic was designed to facilitate self-cleansing and appearance of an emergence profile.

CR_ENG_8,English,"A 29-yr-old woman with no prior known medical illness presented on March 2004 with an oral ulcer and knee joint pain. She had no specific past medical history before. Celecoxib was prescribed by a rheumatologist on 17 March under the suspicion of arthritis.
During the course of routine clinical examination, one pulmonary nodule was found in the left upper lung field on chest radiography. High-resolution lung computed tomography (CT) suggested active pulmonary tuberculosis. She was treated with isoniazid, rifampicin, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide from March 25th. On April 28th (34 and 42 days after the initiation of anti-Tb drugs and celecoxib, respectively), she was hospitalized due to jaundice and hepatomegaly.
On admission, her temperature was 38℃, blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg, and heart rate was 90 beats per min. She had an exanthematous rash on her trunk and limbs with some pustules (), decreased bibasilar lung sound, icteric sclera, hepatosplenomegaly, cervical lymphadenopathy, and posterior pharyngeal wall injection. Blood cell counts showed hemoglobin 12.4 g/dL, leukocyte count 19,990/µL (polymorphs 45.6%, lymphocytes 28.4%, and eosinophils 12.4% [upper limit of normal (ULN) 6%]), and platelet count 261,000/µL. On her peripheral blood smear, neutrophilic leukocytosis with eosinophilia was noted without atypical lymphocytosis. Laboratory data at the patient's first admission are summarized in . Serologic tests for viral infections including hepatitis A and B, Epstein-Barr virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus were negative. Auto-antibody screening revealed negative antinuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-smooth-muscle antibody (SMA). A skin biopsy () showed intraepidermal eosinophil infiltration and spongiosis with pustule formation. Perivascular inflammatory cell cuffing was also noted. The chest radiography showed right pleural effusion with pneumonic consolidation. The previous nodule in the left upper lung showed no interval change. DHS was suspected and all anti-Tb drugs and celecoxib were stopped. Intravenous methylprednisolone (1,000 mg daily) for DHS and antimicrobial therapy (intravenous ceftriaxone 2 g daily and amikacin 1 g daily) for pneumonia were administered for 5 days, followed by oral prednisone 75 mg daily and ursodeoxycholic acid 200 mg three times daily. Fever and rash gradually resolved and liver function started to improve. She was discharged on day 19 (17 May).
Seven days later (24 May), the patient was readmitted. She took her medicine intermittently after discharge. She presented with a rash on forearm, sore throat, myalgia, swallowing difficulty, and dyspnea. Over the next 3 days, she was febrile up to 38℃, and the rash extended to whole body with vesicle and pustule formation. Laboratory findings at second admission are also outlined in . The CT scan of abdomen showed hepatomegaly with perihepatic fluid collection. A bone marrow biopsy disclosed moderate hypercellular marrow with diffuse infiltration of eosinophils.
The diagnosis of a recurrent DRESS syndrome was made, and methylprednisolone 1,000 mg daily was infused intravenously for 3 days. On day 4 of readmission, myalgia and swallowing difficulty became more profound and muscle weakness developed. Right biceps muscle biopsy () showed diffuse endomysial and perimysial infiltration of eosinophils with myonecrosis. Her serum creatine kinase (CK) increased up to 18,943 IU/L (ULN 217 IU/L), and electromyography showed typical myopathic changes. Tests were negative for SMA and anti Jo-1 antibodies. A diagnosis of eosinophilic polymyositis was made. Intravenous cyclosporine 100 mg daily and oral methylprednisolone 60 mg daily were initiated. However, respiratory muscle weakness exacerbated requiring mechanical ventilatory support with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) infusion (1 g/kg/day for 2 days) on day 8 of readmission. After 2 weeks of mechanical ventilation, her respiratory function improved and the ventilator was weaned. At that time, a trans bronchial lung biopsy disclosed chronic granulomatous inflammation without significant eosinophilic infiltrate and a sputum AFB stain revealed a positive finding. Anti-Tb treatment with second-line drugs (cycloserine 500 mg daily, ofloxacin 400 mg daily, prothion-amide 250 mg daily, and streptomycin 1 g five times weekly) was restarted on June 12th, and cyclosporine was discontinued on June 27th. After two more cycles (each cycle included 2 days of immunoglobulin infusion [1 g/kg/day]) of IVIG, skin lesions and liver function improved. The prednisone was gradually tapered to 40 mg daily, and the patient was discharged on July 9th.
Over the next two months, the prednisone dosage was reduced to 20 mg daily and an azathioprine (AZT) 50 mg daily was added on August 27th because her serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level was fluctuating and we worried about the side effect of long-term steroid therapy in the patient with Tb. Two weeks after initiation of AZT, she had a return of fever, up to 37.6℃, jaundice, and a tender liver. Laboratory findings at the third admission showed a cholestatic pattern, which was common in AZT toxicity (). AZT was stopped on September 12th, and only oral prednisone was maintained at a dosage of 10 to 20 mg daily with one more cycle of IVIG. Afterwards, the serum ALT level became normalized and complete resolution of all symptoms was achieved 14 months after discontinuation of the celecoxib and first line anti-Tb drugs. Prednisone was completely tapered in June 2005.
Four weeks after discontinuation of the prednisone, patch-testing was performed with the celecoxib and first-line anti-Tb drugs to evaluate a causal relationship. Tablets were crushed and incorporated at 10% and 50% in white petrolatum. The results showed diffuse erythematous rash around the celecoxib, rifampicin, and ethambutol at day 2. Then, the rash was localized to the celecoxib and ethambutol at day 4, and it was more prominent near the celecoxib (). Taken together, her episode was more likely induced by the celecoxib which probably played a major contributory role, and other first-line anti-Tb drugs played a minor contributory role. Second-line anti-Tb drugs were administered until October 2005. Her liver function had been completely normalized without recurrence of symptoms, and follow-up lung CT also showed complete resolution of pulmonary Tb.","

CR_ENG_9,English,"An 8-year-old Caucasian male presented to our facility with a 2-week history of refractory clear rhinorrhea, facial pain, jaw pain, and somnolence. The patient had previously been diagnosed with sporadic GS after being found to have multiple basal cell nevi and pitting of the palms and soles at the age of 5, as well as more recently a second relapse of ALL and chemotherapy-associated neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count 0/mm3). Family history was negative for GS but revealed a maternal third cousin with osteosarcoma and a maternal second cousin with ALL. The patient denied double vision, decreased vision, and nasal obstruction but did have one episode of epistaxis on the day of admission. There was no known exposure to nickel or significant secondhand smoke exposure. At the time of evaluation he was receiving micafungin for anti-fungal prophylaxis. On physical examination there was a pale gray lesion on the palate suspicious for avascular tissue, versus underlying Gorlin-related cyst. Black debris in the nares was believed to be due to epistaxis; deeper examination revealed grey/brown tissue and nasal polyposis. Because of concerns regarding ionizing radiation, evaluation with MRI was pursued.
MRI demonstrated sharply delineated hypoenhancement of the nasal septum and bilateral inferior turbinates consistent with necrosis, which extended inferiorly to the hard palate and superiorly to the inferior aspect of the sphenoid body (Figures and ). There was no MRI evidence of intracranial extension. There was no significant mucosal swelling or edema, or other mucosal signal abnormalities, on short-tau inversion recovery (STIR) images (). A large cyst centered on the crown of a left maxillary molar consistent with odontogenic cyst extended into and expanded the left maxillary sinus (). Smaller cysts with a similar appearance surrounded the roots of a right maxillary molar (Figures and ) and a mandibular molar (not shown). A right convexity collection consistent with subdural hemorrhage complicated the imaging findings.
Treatment with liposomal amphotericin B and oral posaconazole was initiated and micafungin continued. Surgical biopsy taken from the hard palate revealed focal areas of necrosis. Gömöri methenamine-silver stains demonstrated tissue invasion by wide, sparsely septated hyphae, consistent with Zygomycetes or Aspergillus. Tissue cultures were sterile. Due to the poor prognosis of the patient's underlying disease and quality of life concerns, aggressive surgical management was not pursued.
Despite antifungal therapy, the patient continued to deteriorate clinically. CT at one month after diagnosis demonstrated extension of sinonasal disease, new orbital invasion, demineralization of the nasal turbinates, and a small focus of nasal septal destruction. The patient's course was complicated by Enterococcus faecium bacteremia, disseminated Candida famata infection, and progressive obstruction of the upper airway. He expired two months following the diagnosis of AIFRS.","

CR_ENG_10,English,"A 43-year-old woman presented in June 2016 with abdominal pain and left iliac fossa tenderness. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed colonic inflammation with intraluminal whorled, hyperdense matter – thought to be a bezoar – without high-grade large bowel obstruction []. Although symptoms settled with laxative treatment, she continued to have abdominal pain. This worsened in May 2018, and a repeat CT scan showed a bezoar apparently impacted at the junction of the descending colon and sigmoid, with distal sigmoid collapse, upstream colonic dilatation, and probable inflammation secondary to subacute obstruction []. Failure to dislodge the impacted mass at open surgery led to sigmoid resection and anastomosis. Visual inspection confirmed the radiological impression of a bezoar.
Her past medical history was extremely complex, with chronic bowel symptoms: early satiety, constipation alternating with diarrhea, bloating, and nausea initially diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). Severe constipation with fecal impaction necessitated hospital admission in 1997. Frequent nocturnal palpitations, chest pain, and dizziness led to normal extended cardiac rhythm monitoring, echocardiograms, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging, and stress myocardial perfusion scanning.
The postoperative course was marked by severe nausea, anorexia, weight loss, and cognitive dullness. Psychiatric evaluation did not detect any evidence of mental illness, and she denied voluntarily ingesting hair. She did, however, admit to possible exposure to animal fur from her pets.
At neurological review, walking difficulties were noted since adolescence, with toe walking and contractures of the Achilles tendons. Subsequently, neck weakness and proximal weakness in the lower limbs developed particularly over the 2 years before presentation. On examination, she had ptosis, wasted temporalis muscles producing a “hatchet facies,” and a weak, thin “swan neck” with wasted sternocleidomastoids. Eye movements were normal with no nystagmus. Myotonia was evident in the handgrip and on percussion of the thenar eminence and the forearm extensor muscles. The distal upper and lower limbs were weak. Reflexes were absent in the lower limbs, whereas the sensory examination was normal.
Serum creatine kinase was elevated at 370 IU/L. Electromyography confirmed the presence of myotonia with myopathic motor unit potentials without evidence of muscle fiber irritability. Left quadriceps muscle biopsy was consistent with myopathic changes.","

CR_ENG_11,English,"A 62-year-old man with a history of end stage renal disease on hemodialysis, AIDS being noncompliant with highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), coronary artery disease on aspirin and clopidogrel, compensated alcoholic cirrhosis, stroke, and hypertension presented with bright red blood per rectum for two weeks. He denied presence of nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, or significant weight loss. Vitals were stable, and lab work was remarkable for pancytopenia (hemoglobin 6.3 g/dL, platelet 70/mcL, and white blood cell 2.0/mcL). Liver function tests and coagulation markers were in normal range, and CD4 count was 212/mm3. Colonoscopy showed two stenosed ulcerated short segments in transverse colon with active oozing (requiring epinephrine injection therapy) and normal looking mucosa in between the lesions (Figures –). Another stenosed segment with mass-like appearance was also noted in the transverse colon giving the macroscopic appearance of a mass (). Biopsy from ulcer and mass showed presence of fibrinopurulent debris with granulation tissue. No neoplastic cells or infectious etiology was identified. He underwent an EGD which showed similar lesions but with no overt bleeding or stigmata of recent hemorrhage. The bleeding resolved, and the patient was discharged with emphasis on compliance with HAART and with instructions to attend outpatient GI clinic, suspecting an infectious etiology. Three weeks after his index admission, he was readmitted for recurrent symptoms of acute onset bright red blood per rectum and drop in hemoglobin by 5 g/dl. Repeat colonoscopy revealed healing stenosed segments at the same location with minimal erythema (Figures –) with the overall impression being of improving colitis. Biopsy from the lesions showed rare CMV-positive cells in a background of granulation tissue. The previously seen mass-like lesion had improved to an ulcerated area on this repeat colonoscopy. The initial tumor-like appearance but lack of malignant cells on histopathology and its resolution on follow-up colonoscopy with HAART confirmed our initial suspicion of a pseudotumor. Due to his recurrent GI bleeding with background thrombocytopenia, a discussion with the cardiologists resulted in a coronary angiography showing absence of significant occlusive disease and consequent cessation of dual antiplatelet therapy.
Objective improvement in the colonic lesions based on serial colonoscopies with improved compliance with HAART therapy precluded the need for CMV-directed therapy. At the time of discharge, the patient was recounselled on the need of compliance with HAART. A 3-month follow-up colonoscopy showed continued healing at the stenosis site and absence of pseudotumor ().","

CR_ENG_12,English,"The management of a 58-year-old man with post-hepatitis C advanced cirrhosis, mild ascites and massive haematemesis come to the emergency department of our hospital is referred. The patient presented in our emergency department with massive haematemesis, hypotension (blood pressure 90/60 mmHg), tachycardia (110 beats per minute) and anaemia (haemoglobin level 9 mg/dL). Haemodynamic instability of the patient was treated by blood transfusions and by Blakemore tube placement in the stomach. An emergency contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) showed large gastroesophageal varices and an occluded TIPS (Fig. a) placed 3 years ago at another hospital. A TIPS recanalisation with gastroesophageal varices embolisation was planned in emergency setting. The hemodynamically stabilised patient signed a specific institutional procedure-related consent form that covers retrospective observational studies. The procedure was performed by an experienced (> 20 years) interventional radiologist (M.V.) during patient conscious sedation.
After the placement of a 7-F introducer in the right jugular vein, the occluded TIPS was crossed using a 0.035-in. hydrophilic guidewire (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) and a 4-F Headhunter catheter (Cordis, Miami Lakes, FL, USA). Portal pressure was 36 mmHg. The preliminary portography showed large gastroesophageal varices (Fig. b). First gastric varices (Fig. c), then oesophageal varices (Fig. d) were catheterised with a coaxial microcatheter (1.9 Carnelian, Tokai, Sarayashiki Taraga Kasugay City, Japan) and progressively embolised with detachable coils (18–20-mm diameter, 30–50-cm length; Interlock, Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA, USA) and an (EVOH) copolymer agent (Squid-Peri 34, Emboflu, Gland, Switzerland). EVOH liquid embolic agent was shacked for 15–20 min and, before administration, the microcatheter dead space was filled with DMSO. Squid was then slowly injected to minimise DMSO-related pain due to its endothelial toxicity, progressively retracting the microcatheter to avoid its entrapment. No pain was recorded during Squid administration. After gastroesophageal varices embolisation, a self-expandable bare metal stent (12 mm diameter, 8 cm length; Wallstent, Boston Scientific Corporation, Marlborough, MA, USA) was overlapped to the previous stent and finally a balloon-angioplasty (10 mm diameter, 4 cm length, 18 atm insufflation pressure) of the whole TIPS was performed (Fig. e). Portal pressure at the end of the procedure was 24 mmHg. The final portography showed a quick opacification of the TIPS and the right atrium without gastroesophageal varices evidence, as good function of the portosystemic shunt (Fig. f). Contrast material administered during the procedure was about 60 mL of Iopromide (Ultravist 370, Bayer HealthCare, Berlin, Germany). After the procedure, clinical stabilisation of the patient was achieved, blood transfusions were suspended and Blakemore tube was removed. At discharge 6 days after the procedure, haemoglobin level was 11.4 mg/dL. No rebleeding episodes were recorded during 6 months of follow-up. Colour Doppler ultrasound at 24 h and at 1 and 6 months confirmed the TIPS patency.","

CR_ENG_13,English,"A 54-year-old Hispanic man with hypertension presented to our emergency department with a 2-week history of fever, chills, cough, and progressively worsening dyspnea. The patient reported SARS-CoV-2 positive contacts at home. He denied abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and any tobacco, alcohol, or illicit drug use. The patient had previously seen his primary care physician for these symptoms within the past week and reported that he had tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via polymerase chain reaction (PCR). His SARS-CoV-2 PCR done in the emergency department on the day of admission was negative. This was presumed a false negative test due to the significant SARS-CoV-2 contacts at home, positive test obtained by his primary care physician, and clinical presentation.
Upon presentation to the emergency department, the patient was febrile to 38°C, tachycardic, tachypneic, and hypoxic to 77%, and using his accessory muscles of respiration. On examination, crepitus was palpated along the supraclavicular region and neck bilaterally but not along the sternum. The patient endorsed chest pain with palpation. His respiratory exam was notable for bilateral crackles extending to the mid lung fields bilaterally. His oxygen saturation improved to 95% on 8 L of oxygen via a non-rebreather mask at 100% FiO2.
Blood test results showed elevated leukocytes at 17,200 (4500–10,000 cells/µL) with neutrophils 15,700 (1800–8000 cells/µL) and lymphocytes 900 (1200–3300 cells/µL), procalcitonin level of 0.27 (⩽0.09 ng/mL), and C-reactive protein concentration of 23.6 (0–0.74 mg/dL). Arterial blood gas at admission revealed metabolic alkalosis with arterial pH of 7.47, partial pressure of oxygen of 93 mm Hg, arterial bicarbonate of 29.8 (22–26 mmol/L), and normal partial pressure of carbon dioxide. Chest X-ray done at admission showed confluent bilateral ground-glass opacities and pneumomediastinum with subcutaneous emphysema at the base of the neck (). No pleural effusion, pleural thickening, or pneumothorax was noted. Computed tomography (CT) thorax without contrast confirmed bilateral peripheral consolidation and revealed diffuse pneumomediastinum ( and ).
The patient was hospitalized for acute hypoxic respiratory failure and SPM secondary to SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia and treated per our hospital protocol with Ceftriaxone and Azithromycin for 5 days, Remdesivir for 5 days, and intravenous Dexamethasone for 10 days. He was initially admitted to the medical intensive care unit (ICU) and downgraded on day 3 of admission after demonstrating stable oxygen saturations on a non-rebreather mask at 100% FiO2. He was eventually weaned down to nasal cannula on day 6 of admission. Chest X-ray performed on hospital day 7 showed radiographic resolution of pneumomediastinum and subcutaneous emphysema with persistent bibasilar infiltrates (). He was discharged home on day 8 of admission with 2 L/min of nasal cannula with oxygen saturations above 94%. He remained afebrile and hemodynamically stable throughout his hospital course.","

CR_ENG_14,English,"A 41-year-old female first visited our clinic for a feeling of strangeness in the left upper molar region in August 2000. The left mandibular third molar was transplanted to the left maxillary second molar part (Fig. ).
Due to severe periodontal disease, upper left #7 could not be preserved and we explained to the patient that they would require tooth extraction. We explained that they would be managed with dentures and oral implant treatments or tooth transplantation after extraction (Fig. ). The patient requested tooth transplantation, so we performed a transplant of left maxillary second molar using lower left #8 as a donor tooth. During the transplant surgery, local infiltration anesthesia was administered to left maxillary second molar and left mandibular third molar, and then, left mandibular third molar was extracted with the utmost care to avoid injury to the periodontal ligament. Next, we performed drilling to create the transplant bed and created the space to insert a round bur and the implant. We then elevated the maxillary sinus floor using an osteotome. In order to conduct tooth transplantation, the shape of the tooth removed for transplantation and attachment condition of the periodontal membrane was measured using a probe. Based on the length and shape of the root of the transplanting tooth, a three-dimensional transplant socket, which was slightly bigger than the root of the transplanting tooth, was created. Finally, the transplanting tooth was placed into the transplant socket, and fitting was adjusted by grinding the constricted part based on the pulling out resistance of the transplanting tooth. The left mandibular third molar was transplanted into the transplant socket and secured using sutures (Fig. ). The patient was administered antibiotics and analgesics after surgery. The postoperative course was favorable.
About 3 weeks after transplantation, endodontic treatment was started for the transplanted tooth, and abutment construction was performed with a metal core after root canal obturation. Prosthesis treatment was performed for the defective left maxillary first molar, using the left maxillary second premolar and maxillary second molar as abutment teeth for bridging (Fig. ).","

CR_ENG_15,English,"A 14 year old Caucasian female presented to our pediatric scleroderma clinic with a 4 year history of progressive mixed morphea, a combination of generalized plaque morphea and linear scleroderma of the trunk/ extremities. Her condition started as a single bruise-like lesion over the right flank, and despite systemic therapy, had advanced to cover approximately 80% of her body surface area.
A deep punch biopsy of the initial lesion demonstrated histologic findings consistent with LS (morphea), including full thickness dermal fibrosis with a superficial and deep perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate. In addition, there was thickening of the fibrous septa in the panniculus with aggregates of plasma cells at the edges, supporting deeper involvement. An eosinophilic infiltrate was not present in the subcutis. She was initially treated with topical corticosteroids, but these were discontinued due to their ineffectiveness to halt disease with expansion of lesions noted. Oral treatment was initiated, though not considered as standard therapy, with penicillin VK and hydroxychloroquine (400mg daily) (Fig. ). Approximately 1 year later she was started on more traditional steroid and methotrexate therapy, initially with oral prednisone, followed by IV methylprednisolone administered per Toronto protocol (1000 mg IV daily three consecutive days) []. Due to intolerability of the methotrexate (maximal dose 17.5 mg subcutaneous weekly), she was switched to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and continued on it for another year at a maximum dose of 1500 mg twice daily. She started to complain of odd side effects with MMF, including migraine headache and short term memory loss, leading to its eventual discontinuation. She received another course of monthly three consecutive days of 1000 mg daily IV methylprednisolone for 3 months prior to our evaluation in clinic (Fig. ).
The history obtained from the patient and documentation from the treating physician at the time of our initial consultation supported a partial response to both oral prednisone and IV methylprednisolone pulses, characterized by less stiffness and slightly improved joint mobility. Other therapies were not thought to contribute to a significant change in disease course (above). In the months prior to evaluation in our clinic she continued to show continued disease progression, characterized by appearance of new, expanding, and thickening of lesions. Her review of systems was otherwise unremarkable for signs of systemic sclerosis, including absence of Raynaud phenomenon, or other overlapping connective tissue disease features apart from signs of upper GI irritation while on prednisone.
On our initial examination, she demonstrated a variety of findings, including both active disease and damage features. Most notably were two overall cutaneous and deep tissue patterns. One consisted of diffuse large coalescing plaque morphea lesions covering her trunk, with mild erythematous borders, yellow/white waxy indurated centers and moderate to severe skin thickness throughout. The other consisted of deep linear bands of thick skin traveling down the majority of her upper and lower extremities, concentrated on the extensor surfaces, spreading out and affecting the digits with diffuse limitation range of motion of both large and small joints. An associated general edema was also demonstrated of her peripheral extremities. Please see pre-treatment photographs in Figs. (, ) and pre- infliximab treatment durometer readings (skin hardness) and joint function in Table .
Her initial laboratory investigation included a negative ANA (due to this negative value no other extractable nuclear antigens were tested at presentation), and was only remarkable for a mild eosinophilia with absolute count of 630 and mild elevation in the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, 34mm/hr (normal ≤ 20mm/hr). The C-reactive protein level was normal. Subsequent laboratory evaluation showed the development of a positive ANA at 1:320 titer with negative values for routine extractable nuclear antigens, including Scl-70. The single stranded DNA antibody, which is associated with more severe LS, was positive at 130 U/mL (normal value ≤ 69).
Infliximab was considered in our patient due to medication intolerance and disease progression during the use of standard LS therapies, MTX, MMF and corticosteroids. A review of the literature found a few cases of infliximab's efficacy in adults with generalized morphea (no pediatric cases had been reported) and its effect on skin improvement in both limited and diffuse cutaneous forms of systemic sclerosis [-]. Infliximab (10mg/kg) was administered to our patient as monthly infusions. She was followed locally by another pediatric rheumatology provider (PW) and within the first 2 infusions her fingers and ankles felt less full/stiff and skin less thick on her trunk. Four months into infliximab therapy, leflunomide was started to supplement therapy and to decrease the likelihood of formation of auto-antibodies to infliximab. She continued with physical and occupational therapy, and in conjunction with systemic therapy, allowed her to regain a large amount of lost function. Her additional medications included a proton-pump inhibitor and an anti-histamine. She did not have any serious complications with therapy, although she developed a herpetic mouth lesion 9 months into infliximab therapy which required treatment with oral valacyclovir prior to resolution.
At a follow-up clinic visit at our center, 9 months after the initiation of infliximab therapy, the patient reported a significant improvement in the range of motion of almost all her joints and marked improvement of her grip strength. Table reports the improvement in the joint and skin findings post-infliximab. She noted that her skin felt less thick, which was confirmed in several areas on physical examination using the modified Rodnan skin score assessment (0-3 scale). The improvement was further supported by the comparison of durometer readings (skin hardness) for several lesions, pre- and post-treatment (Table ). In general, on examination the thick/indurated waxy lesions broke up into smaller islands of decreased skin thickness and the erythematous halo had resolved in regard to the large plaque morphea type of lesions. The linear lesions affecting the upper and lower extremities still had areas with moderate to severe thickness within the bands, but these were narrow and more isolated to the center of the lesion compared to prior. The general edema of the distal upper and lower extremities greatly diminished and the overall ROM of large and small joints improved (see Table and Fig. ).
Our clinic uses a comprehensive (and validated) skin scoring technique that includes the modified localized scleroderma skin severity index (mLoSSI) to reflect cutaneous disease activity [] and the localized scleroderma damage index (LoSDI) to reflect cutaneous disease damage components [], which together compose the localized scleroderma cutaneous assessment tool (LoSCAT). Other prospectively collected clinical outcomes measured are standardized joint range of motion (ROM) charting (including finger to palm distance) [], the Childhood Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) [] and global assessment of disease severity on a 10cm VAS scale from the perspective of the parent, the child and the treating physician []. In general, other objective modalities are employed to monitor responsiveness to therapy in LS include imaging (MRI, Ultrasound, thermography) and non-imaging techniques, such as the computerized skin score [], skin biopsy and durometer measures. In our clinic, we will commonly employ the durometer in tandem assessment to clinical cutaneous scoring []. The durometer is an engineering tool developed to assess the hardness of materials and has been used to assess the hardness of sclerodermatous skin for several years. A study in 2008 found that durometer readings have excellent correlation with disease activity in systemic sclerosis and are helpful in giving an objective measure for multiple skin points []. Additionally, they noted that the variance in durometer readings correlates well to the patient’s experience and frequently there are improvements in durometer changes readings that correlate with the patients perception [].
In our patient, there was significant improvement in almost all scores (cutaneous, joint and global assessment) after 9 months of treatment with infliximab (Table ). Of note, both accepted measures of disease activity in LS, the mLoSSI and PGA-A [], improved markedly by reaching pre-determined minimal clinically important difference scores (6 and 41, respectively) [], confirming a truly significant clinical change in disease status.","

CR_ENG_18,English,"A 48-year-old female patient was admitted to the Sir Run Run Shaw Hospital (Hangzhou, China) due to a large mass in the bladder identified during a health examination in June 2011. The patient exhibited no mass-related symptoms, such as pain, gross haematuria or urinary irritation. Seven years prior to admission, the patient underwent surgical resection of a bladder mass, which was diagnosed as HPC of the bladder. However, the patient did not attend regular follow-up examinations after the surgery. The patient was otherwise healthy. Computed tomography (CT) scans showed a well-defined, heterogeneously enhancing 6.2×5.0-cm solid cystic mass in the bladder (). Cystoscopy showed extrinsic compression of the right bladder wall, but the bladder mucosa was normal. The physical examination was unremarkable. No lymph node or distant metastasis was found. Following a thorough pre-operative evaluation, the patient underwent complete excision of the tumour and a partial cystectomy. The tumour was 6.5×5.0×4.0 cm in size, with an intact external surface. The cut surface of the tumour was grey-white, with a medium texture.
The histopathological examination revealed a neoplasm consisting of spindle-shaped cells, which were arranged around the vasculature, with a ‘staghorn’ configuration (). The images captured were hypercellular and showed cells that exhibited oval nuclei. Mitosis was rare and necrosis was not present. The neoplastic cells exhibited marked positivity for Bcl-2 and were negative for cluster of differentiation (CD)34, CD31, factor VIII, epithelial membrane antigen, S100, chromogranin A, cytokeratin (CK)7 and CK19. The proliferation marker, Ki-67, was positive in <5% of the tumour cells. The histopathological diagnosis was HPC of the bladder and surgical margins were noted to be tumour-negative.

CR_ENG_19,English,"In a trip to Geneina, Darfur, Sudan organized by the Arab Medical Union, in a voluntary medical mission to a local hospital, our team operated on a 61-year-old female patient (with 11 sons and daughters, the youngest of which was 31 years old). The patient had no concomitant morbidity, no past history (surgical or medical), and no relevant family medical history. The patient presented with a huge neck swelling that was interfering with her normal movements, and which she complained was giving her a sense of tightness and heaviness (). Obviously, cosmetic aspects of such a large goitre were also mentioned. The patient first noticed the goitre 40 years ago, which gradually progressed in size, but with no obstructive or compressive symptoms. The goitre measured approximately 27 × 23 cm in its largest dimensions and displayed multidirectional enlargement: anteriorly, where it was pendulous over the sternum; posteriorly; superiorly, to the mandible and floor of the mouth; and inferiorly, where the lower border or edge of the goitre could not be palpated (suggesting substernal extension). The goitre did not display mobility with deglutition. A thyroid hormone profile confirmed the euthyroid status of the patient during routine preoperative tests. Although we considered the possibility of malignancy, no logistic medical facilities were available to aid in diagnosis such as the fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC). Therefore, the decision to operate was made based on the patient's complaints and the possibility of a hidden malignancy.
During surgery, contrary to our expectations, we were able to smoothly intubate the patient. We started with a transverse elliptical excision of the redundant skin. The strap muscles were thinned-out and had to be cut for proper exposure. After formal exposure of the thyroid gland, the swelling was observed to extend in all directions: upwards to the base of the tongue; downwards, behind the sternum, down to manubrio-sternal junction; and backwards, lying on the vertebrae. Anatomical landmarks were disturbed to such an extent that carotid sheaths were adhered to the swelling, nearly constituting one mass. Feeding and draining vessels were megalised and engorged. We proceeded with formal total thyroidectomy, starting with the right lobe (the largest lobe). Although we could not identify the recurrent laryngeal nerves (our routine practice), we were able to identify and preserve 2 of the parathyroid glands (on the left side).
After completion of the thyroid excision, tracheomalacia was observed, which necessitated insertion of a tracheostomy. Before the tracheostomy, a trial of extubation was attempted by the anesthetist, but stridor and lowered arterial O2 saturation occurred. Therefore, we inserted the tracheostomy. Closure of the wound was quite difficult because of the thinned-out strap muscles, nearly atrophied platysma muscle and the redundant skin.
The resulting thyroid specimen was 35 × 27 cm in its largest dimensions and weighed 4.7 kg (). Histopathological examination showed a multi-nodular goitre with multiple cysts and areas of haemorrhage and necrosis. The patient was kept under our supervision at a local hospital for 2 days, with no postoperative complications, but had to be transferred to the ICU of a separate hospital, because of lack of personnel, equipment, and other resources at this primitive local hospital. Unfortunately, because of a lack of experience at that hospital, the patient died from a mucous plug in the tracheostomy tube, two days after surgery.","

He reported episodes of loss of consciousness and falling on his wife immediately after ejaculation. It was followed by tonic clonic movements in all four limbs as reported by his wife. Each episode lasted a few minutes. He would feel the heaviness in his head and dazed feeling after regaining his consciousness. He did not report feeling any discomfort during foreplay and the initial part of sex. This continued after every act of sexual intercourse and ejaculation leading to a gradual reduction in the frequency of sexual intercourses. It led to marital strain and feeling of frustration and helplessness in the patient. These seizures were seen exclusively after sexual intercourse initially, and 3 years later he reported experiencing 5–6 episodes during which he dropped objects held in hand, was unresponsive and slumped to the ground, each lasting few seconds. It happened at different times of the day and was not associated with the sexual interaction. His neurological examination did not reveal any significant finding.

CR_ENG_22,English,"A 16-year-old Chinese boy presented with dizziness and projectile vomiting for 3 months. He was admitted at the Neurosurgery Department of Beijing Tiantan Hospital in November 2009 after a progressive exacerbation of symptoms, with unsteady walking and increased blood pressure. Physical examination revealed lucidity, equal reaction of pupils to light, full eye movement, facial symmetry, lolling and muscle dystrophy of the left part of the tongue, bilateral gag hyporeflexia, soft neck, grade V limbs muscle strength, normal muscle tone, Rombergism positive, and bilaterally positive Babinski’s sign. Blood pressure was 142/110 mmHg.
Computed tomography (CT) revealed an intracranial space-occupying lesion. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) confirmed the lesion (size: 2.5×2.0×2.0 cm) in the left part of the ventral medulla oblongata (). The lesion was significantly enhanced after contrast injection. The medulla oblongata was extruded, with peritumoral edema. The patient was a full-term delivery and had no family history of hypertension and coronary heart disease.
Tumor resection was performed in the right lateral position. Surgical time was 6 hours including 2.5 hours for tumor removal. The left vertebral artery and posterior cranial nerve were located on the surface of the tumor. The tumor was completely removed by resection under a microscope. After resection, the left vertebral artery and posterior cranial nerve remained intact. Total intraoperative bleeding was 300 mL. Blood loss due to the tumor resection per se was about 50 mL. The surrounding tissues were shielded using gauze and all blood leaking was suctioned, leaving almost no blood in the arachnoid space. Pathological examination was consistent with diagnosis of schwannoma. Indeed, hematoxylin and eosin staining () identified the classic Antoni A and Antoni B regions. In the Antoni A region, cells were closely arranged with a palisade-like structure. In the Antoni B region, the cells were arranged loosely. Immunohistochemical analysis was then performed, which revealed that the tumor was S100 positive, EMA negative, and GFAP negative, which was consistent with the schwannoma.
At day 1 after surgery, the pupils were equally sensitive to light. Wound dressing was clean and dry. The patient presented airway obstruction, and tracheal intubation was performed to secure airway patency. The airway obstruction did not improve even two days after surgery. Hence, dehydration therapy and tracheotomy were performed in the supine position. Three days after surgery, the patient was in a hazy consciousness state. CT showed an ischemic infarction at the bilateral internal carotid arteries and posterior cerebral artery (), which was not present on day 1 (). Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) showed stenosis at the carotid siphon and distal basilar artery, which was segmental (). Hyperdynamic hemodilutional therapy and nimodipine were started. Four days after surgery, the patient was in coma state. His body temperature was 39°C, and hence physical cooling was performed. Penicillin was replaced with vancomycin and ceftazidime. The patient received 50 mL of nimodipine q 12 h, hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4, and 4.5 g of sodium chloride (500 mL/day), and the amount of fluid was increased to 3,000–3,500 mL/day. Five days after surgery, the level of consciousness of the patient was not improved. There was no clear liquid exudate at the incision. The dressing was clean and dry. Six days after surgery, the patient was unconscious. CT revealed that the infarction was located in the frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal lobes (). Seven days after surgery, the level of consciousness was not improved. The infarction size increased. Dehydration therapy was carried out, without success. Decompressive craniectomy was successfully performed in the frontal and temporal parts (). Head dressing was clean and dry. The bone window was correctly replaced, the trachea incision was unobstructed, and the patient had small amounts of sputum. However, the patient was in a persistent vegetative state, with normal vital signs.
The Karnofsky performance status score before surgery was 90. It was 30 on day 1 after surgery; 20 on day 2 after surgery; 10 on day 7 after surgery; and 40 on the last follow-up (ie, five years after surgery).","

CR_ENG_23,English,"The left hand of a right-handed 29-year-old man was injured by a meat chopper. The injured fingers were not replantable; therefore, amputation of the middle and ring fingers at the level of the proximal phalanx and of the little finger at the middle phalanx was performed at another hospital (). The patient's occupation was chef at an Indian restaurant. Six months following the injury, the patient was referred to our hospital for hand reconstruction. Radiographic images confirmed the clinical findings (). The patient's preoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) score was 4/10 (this score is based on the patient's phantom pain after the finger amputations) and his Quick-DASH was 81.82/100.00. Examination of foot vascularity with contrast-enhanced computed tomography confirmed that bilateral STT was compatible for the reconstruction of two fingers (). Therefore, one year after the injury, the bilateral second toes were transferred to the middle and ring fingers.
A curved incision was made over the volar surface of the distal middle and ring fingers (). We identified the digital artery, digital nerve, and flexor digitorum profundus on the volar side. The digital artery and digital nerve were isolated to provide for inflow and reinnervation.
First, the dorsalis pedis artery and superficial dorsal vein were marked under ultrasound guidance. A v-shaped incision was made at the base of the second toe and extended proximally. The superficial dorsal veins, first dorsal metacarpal artery, and extensor digitorum longus were dissected on the dorsal side. A plantar dissection was also made, and the flexor digitorum longus and proper palmer digital nerves were identified. Disarticulation was performed at the second metatarsophalangeal joint. While harvesting the second toe from the recipient artery, long pedicle was maintained in order to facilitate vascular anastomosis and to avoid the kinking of the artery. The second metatarsal bone was cut at the base to adjust the length of fingers. The foot was closed with a knotless suture fixation system (ZipTight™; Arthrex Inc., FL, USA) to firmly close the wound, avoiding unwanted reduction of tension during the closure ().","

CR_ENG_24,English,"A 43-year-old male patient with underlying diabetes mellitus and a history of admission for meningitis lesser than one year before this current condition presented with lower abdominal pain with radiation to the left thigh. He also complained of having fever and lethargy for the past three days and eventually unable to ambulate due to worsening pain. On physical examination, he appeared lethargic, while his vital signs were still stable. Both iliac fossae were tender, and crepitus was felt along the anteromedial aspect of the left thigh. The neurovascular status of the bilateral lower limbs was intact. Blood investigations showed lymphocytosis. A CT scan was done urgently and revealed retroperitoneal collection from the L1/L2 vertebral body and the collection was extending to bilateral iliacus muscle. However, it extended beyond the iliopsoas insertion on the left side. The CT scan images revealed also the destruction of the first and second lumbar vertebrae (Figure 1).
The patient was resuscitated adequately and, then, taken for surgical intervention on the same day as the presentation. Extensive incision and drainage were done bilaterally. Intraoperatively, more than 1,000 mL pus was drained, and the extensive slough tissue was debrided. The collection was found to unusually breach the deep fascia and extent into the left adductor canal (Figure 2).
During this setting, a diagnostic laparoscopy was also performed, and intra-abdominal involvement was ruled out. Specimens were sent for culture and sensitivity intraoperatively, which later revealed the growth of Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae). The patient was treated with intravenous amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. A repeat CT scan was done one week later and showed a residual collection. The patient was taken in for another surgical drainage, while intravenous antibiotics were continued. Subsequent repeat scan revealed only minimal residual collection, while there was no worsening of vertebral bony destruction. Although the collection was visualized to involve the L1 and L2 vertebral bodies with bony destruction, no surgical interventions were performed for the spine, as the patient did not have neurological deficits and there was no worsening of the spinal column during treatment with intravenous antibiotics.
Eventually, the patient improved clinically and was deemed fit for discharge. He was followed in the outpatient setting. However, eight months later, the patient was re-admitted for a left hip intramuscular abscess for which left hip drainage of the intramuscular abscess and arthrotomy washout was done, revealing about 40 mL of pus. During the same admission, the patient was also treated for lung empyema and bilateral pleural effusion by the surgical and medical team, respectively. Culture and sensitivity of specimens sent intraoperatively yielded growth of K. pneumoniae and he was treated with intravenous meropenem. Unfortunately, the patient eventually succumbed to sepsis due to the deep-seated intramuscular abscess and lung empyema. A written informed consent was obtained from the patient.","

CR_ENG_25,English,"A 71-year-old man with a history of 300 packs per year smoking habit presented with
shortness of breath, bloody sputum, and dyspnea for 4 months. He was diagnosed with advanced
lung cancer radiologically during his first hospitalization and pathologically at his second
hospitalization. A computed tomography (CT) scan showed thyromegaly and thyroid function
tests indicated hypothyroidism.
Laboratory studies showed a low hemoglobin level of 85.50 g/L. Arterial blood gas analysis
showed a pH of 7.41, PO2 of 58.28 mm Hg (80–100 mm Hg), actual bicarbonate level
of 25 mmol/L, and oxygen saturation of 90%. CT imaging showed thyromegaly () and bilateral pulmonary
multiple nodules on 29 December 2015 (. The following findings were consistent with a diagnosis of severe
hypothyroidism: free triiodothyronine level, 1.71 pmol/L (3.09–7.42 pmol/L); free thyroxine
level, 0.86 pmol/L (7.64–16.03 pmol/L); and thyroid-stimulating hormone level, 62.21 mIU/L
(0.49–4.91 mIU/L), with a myxedematous face (. An exfoliative cytological pleural effusion
test showed adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining was positive for cytokeratin 7, and
negative for thyroid transcription factor-1, napsin A, P40, prostate-specific antigen, and
P504S in the following year (. A follow-up chest CT scan showed thyromegaly () and increased nodules in both lungs on 8
January 2018 ( and
Supplemental video).
The patient’s blood pressure was 140/76 mm Hg, heart rate was 76 beats/minute, respiratory
rate was 24 breaths/minute, and oxygen saturation was 85%–90%. He presented with shortness
of breath and orthopnea. There was evidence of symmetric edema in both eyelids and the lower
extremities. Percussion of the lungs revealed a dull sound. Auscultation indicated weak
breathing sounds and moist rale in both lungs. There was a hard, non-sliding, swollen lymph
node without tenderness on both sternocleidomastoids.
Our patient with lung cancer (stage IV) had never previously received any anti-tumor
therapy or anti-hypothyroidism therapy, such as systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and
local treatment, for the tumor. He only accepted supportive therapy, such as moxifloxacin
hydrochloride and cefmetazole, during his three periods of hospitalization. His symptoms of
shortness of breath, bloody sputum, and dyspnea improved and he was discharged. He had
survived the lung cancer for 30 months leading up to the most recent follow-up visit.
All procedures were in accordance with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later
amendments or comparable ethical standards. This report was conducted with approval from the
Clinical Trial Ethics Committee of the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University

CR_ENG_26,English,"A 13-year-old boy weighing 25 kg was suffering from frequently relapsing NS for 6 years. He had undergone renal biopsy 4 years back, which showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis with diffuse IgM deposits on immunofluorescence. At the time of renal biopsy, his serum creatinine was 0.3 mg/dl, serum albumin was 1.8 g/dl, serum cholesterol was 450 mg/dl, and 24 h urine protein was 2.5 g/day. After renal biopsy, he was treated with 15 mg prednisolone, 0.75 mg tacrolimus twice a day, tablet nifedipine retard 20 mg twice a day, tablet losartan 25 mg twice a day, and 10 mg atorvastatin at bedtime, along with calcium and Vitamin D supplements. His tacrolimus level was maintained at 3 ng/ml during treatment. He achieved remission after 4 weeks of therapy. Finally, before the occurrence of the present complication, he came for follow-up in April 2016. At that time, he was asymptomatic and his Hb was 9.9 g/dl, serum creatinine was 0.27 mg/dl, serum albumin was 2.8 g/dl, serum cholesterol was 320 mg/dl, and urinary protein was 600 mg/24 h.
In July 2016, he was admitted with the complaints of oliguria, facial puffiness, vomiting, and abdominal pain, which were severe and continuous for last 3 days. The child was restless and tossing in the bed. He was constipated for 24 h. His urine output was 250 ml/day. On examination, the child looked toxic and pale. Periorbital edema was present. His pulse rate was 86/min regular and BP was 116/70 mmHg. His abdomen was mildly distended and ascites was present. There was no tenderness or rigidity, but bowel sounds were absent.
On investigation, urine examination showed +3 proteinuria with 10–12 red blood cells (RBCs) and occasional WBC/high-power field, 24 h urinary protein was 3.5 g, Hb was 5.3 g/dl, total WBC count was 16,600/cmm, platelet count was 1.2 lakh/cmm, serum creatinine was 2.7 mg/dl, serum albumin was 1.7 g/dl, serum bilirubin was 1.4 mg/dl, SGPT was 125 units, serum sodium was 135 mEq/l, serum potassium was 5.1 mEq/l, serum calcium was 8.6 mg/dl, PT was 22 s (11 s) with INR 1.98, and APTT was 61 s (control – 32 s). Venous blood gas analysis showed pH 7.34, HCO3 16.3, Na 136, K 5.2, and Ca 0.63 mEq/l. Ultrasonography [] of the abdomen revealed normal-sized kidneys without dilatation of pelvicalyceal system, with presence of moderate ascites. Liver and gall bladder were normal, and the portal vein was 8 mm at porta filled with echogenic material extending to splenoportal confluence, suggesting portal vein thrombosis. Doppler [] images showed echogenic filling of portal vein extending to splenoportal confluence and SMV with absent color flow within it. CT angiography [] of the portal vein showed diameter of 11 mm at porta with nonfilling of main portal vein, splenoportal confluence, splenic vein, and SMV, suggesting thrombosis. Wall of the duodenum and small bowel loops appeared thickened and edematous. Diagnostic ascetic taping revealed hemorrhagic fluid showing 1.6 g protein/L, 30–40 RBC/cmm, 20–25 WBC/cmm, and the culture was negative.
The patient was treated with continuous Ryle's tube aspiration, blood transfusion, intravenous (IV) fluids, 20% human albumin, IV imipenem-cilastatin 500 mg 12 hourly, and IV metrogyl 200 mg 8 hourly. His immunosuppressants were stopped. Expert gastroenterologist's and vascular surgeon's opinion was sought. Fibrinogen, fibrin degradation product (FDP) and D-dimer were tested. D-dimer was 1200 mg/ml (Ref: 200–400 mg/ml), fibrinogen was 110 mg/dl (Ref: 150–400 mg/dl), and FDP was 46 mg/l (N: <10 mg/l). CT angiography showed a big segment of bowel loop on the verge of necrosis, but due to impending disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), the child could not be taken up for surgery. After few hours, the child started to have hematemesis. The Ryle's tube aspirate became black and smoky. The aspirated volume increased to 1.2 L. It was treated with conservative measures including fresh frozen plasma. Despite all efforts, the child became hypotensive and hypoxic, requiring ventilator support and increasing dose of inotropes. The child expired the next day morning.","

CR_ENG_27,English,"This boy was a healthy, active 11-year-old who played soccer in his spare time. He and his father were enjoying downhill skiing at a resort in Norway, when another skier, travelling faster, suddenly approached and the collision was unavoidable. The boy was hit on the lateral aspect of his right knee with his foot planted on the ground. This resulted in a pivoting movement with knee valgus and external tibial rotation. The patient was initially cared for at a local hospital, close to the resort. On first examination, he was unable to extend his knee fully and had a knee flexion of about 70°. The patellar apprehension test was negative, he had no pain when palpating the tibiofemoral joint line and he was stable to valgus and varus stress. Plain radiographs showed that the boy had suffered a tibial eminence fracture (). However, what particularly caught the radiologist’s attention was a bony avulsion fragment of uncertain origin. It was assumed to originate from the tibial side, since no femoral defect could be seen. The patient was given a temporary high leg cast and was transferred to another hospital for inpatient care and an MRI evaluation.
The MRI confirmed the medial intercondylar avulsion fracture of the tibia but dismissed the initial thought regarding the origin of the other fragment. This fragment was instead described as ‘a skull-shaped fragment corresponding to the ACL origin of the medial aspect of the lateral femoral condyle’. An additional CT was performed to further assess the pathology of the proximal bony fragment and the interpretation was identical ( and ). So, this patient had suffered a simultaneous avulsion fracture of both the proximal and distal insertion sites of the ACL.","

CR_ENG_28,English,"A 21-yr-old female patient presented with a sudden onset of low abdominal pain. With the clinical impression of an ovarian cyst, she was transferred from a local GYN clinic to our hospital. Gynecologic ultrasonography revealed a large posterior pelvic mass with an irregular echogenicity measuring 9.7×4.2 cm in size (). The patient had no specific past medical history with a parity of 0-0-0-0. A considerable amount of fluid was present in the cul de sac. The uterus and both adnexae were unremarkable. There was no ultrasonographic evidence of lymphadenopathy. Pelviscopy showed a large, thin walled, partly cystic, pelvic mass measuring approximately 10 cm in diameter. The mass was adherent to the internal and external iliac vessels and the right pelvic wall. It was not possible to remove the tumor completely. The retroperitoneal mass was partly removed by pelviscopy and samples were submitted for frozen section analysis.
The submitted specimen for frozen section analysis consisted of multiple irregular fragments of soft tissue weighing approximately 30 g. The tumor was soft and grayish-tan with focal areas of hemorrhage (). On frozen section, the possibility of epithelioid smooth muscle tumor or paraganglioma was suspected. Microscopically, the masses were characterized by a haphazard proliferation of smooth muscle cells (LAM cells) arranged in fascicular, trabecular, and papillary patterns around a ramifying network of endothelium-lined spaces. The cells were plump or epithelioid with abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and bland nuclei with no mitotic activity. These cells invaded into fat tissue surrounding the lesion. The vascular spaces were empty or sometimes filled with eosinophilic material (). Aggregations of lymphocytes were between the LAM cells, representing vestiges of preexisting lymph nodes (). Occasional foci of hemorrhage and necrosis were present.
Most of the LAM cells showed a positive reaction for alphasmooth muscle actin (Dako Co., Carpinteria, CA, U.S.A.), vimentin (Zymed, San Francisco, CA, U.S.A.), desmin (Bio-Genex, San Ramon, CA, U.S.A.), and HMB-45 (Dako) (). S-100 protein (DiNonA Inc. Seoul, Korea), cytokeratin (Dako), chromogranin (Zymed), and CD 34 (Immunotec, Marseille, Cedex, France) were negative. Estrogen (Immunotec) and progesterone (Novocastra Lab. Ltd. Newcastle, U.K.) receptors were observed in only 10% of the LAM cells. Ki-67 (Zymed) was positive in less than 5% of the tumor cells. Clinical evidence of tuberous sclerosis was not present. Evaluation for the TSC gene was not performed.
After operation, the patient had continuous oozing of chylous ascitic fluid of approximately 1,500 to 2,000 mL per day. There was no clinical or radiological evidence of pulmonary involvement at the time of the initial diagnosis. Chylous pleural effusion was also identified two months after the operation. Chest CT scans showed diffuse, small, thin walled cystic lesions in both lung parenchymas with pleural effusion (). The patient was treated with tamoxifen and medroxyprogesterone, but the response was limited. Even after chest tube insertion and pleurodesis, she continued to drain approximately 800 to 2,300 mL of chylous fluid per day. In the terminal stages of the disease, the patient suffered severe respiratory distress and died six months after initial operation.","

CR_ENG_31,English,"A 46-year-old man with no significant medical history presented with progressively increasing pelvic pain for 1 year and exacerbation for 1 month. Physical examination was normal. Laboratory data showed no abnormality. Ultrasonography of the pelvic region revealed a hypoechogenic mass in the right lower quadrant. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed asymmetric multiple fine striations in the right pelvic cavity and dilation of the right internal iliac vein and artery. Computed tomography angiography (CTA) demonstrated a large pelvic AVM with multiple feeding arteries arising from the side branches of the right internal iliac artery especially from the anterior trunk which were draining into right internal iliac vein through a large venous pouch (). Because he had no history of pelvic trauma, neoplasm, or surgery we considered the AVM to be congenital anomaly. The patient was evaluated by a cardiovascular surgeon and interventional radiologist, and endovascular treatment was decided on because of high risk of intraoperative hemorrhage.
The procedure was performed after obtaining a written informed consent of the patient and under general anesthesia. Left common femoral artery and left common femoral vein were punctured simultaneously using the Seldinger technique and 6 F long introducer sheaths (Terumo Destination, Leuven, Belgium) were positioned. 5 F cobra catheters (Cordis Corporation, Bridgewater, NJ, USA) were inserted to access the right internal iliac artery and vein. A pelvic digital subtraction angiography (DSA) was performed. DSA confirmed the findings of the CTA and revealed a large pelvic AVM with multiple feeding arteries originating from the side branches of the right internal iliac artery especially from the anterior trunk. Multiple feeding arteries shunted a single large venous pouch and drainage occurred via the right internal iliac vein ().
Feeding arteries, suitable to microcatheter insertion were superselectively catheterized using a 2.7 F microcatheter (Progreat, Terumo Medical, Leuven, Belgium). These feeding branches were embolized by injection of a total of 10.5 mL Squid-12 (Figures and ). Injection was performed under fluoroscopic guidance and proximal reflux was considered as limitation. The control arteriography after arterial embolization revealed slower flow of the AVM but the venous pouch was still visible because of multiple fine arterial feeders which were inaccessible with microcatheter ().
Next, a 2.7 F microcatheter was positioned in the venous pouch through the cobra catheter placed via the venous access. Contrast injection confirmed the position of the microcatheter in the venous pouch of the AVM (). Subsequently, eight 0.020-inch detachable metallic coils (Penumbra Inc., Alameda, CA, US) and nine 0.018-inch fibered detachable metallic coils (Concerto, ev3 Endovascular, Plymouth, MN, USA) were deployed into the venous pouch leading to occlusion of the outflow drainage (). Residual space in the venous pouch adjacent to the AVM nidus was filled with Squid-12 until complete stasis was achieved. Coils obliterating the outflow of the venous pouch avoided the risk of leakage of the liquid embolic agent into the iliac vein and enabled the retrograde penetration of the Squid-12 into the fine arterial feeders.

CR_ENG_32,English,"The first patient is a 33-year-old man (Figs. and ). He was first seen at the age of 12 after he turned pale during exercise, but did not collapse. His family history was positive for HCM and SCD; his mother died at the age of 33. At that time, he was diagnosed with HCM following detection of asymmetrical LV hypertrophy and an MWT of 33 mm with normal systolic function; he had no LVOT gradient at rest or during the Valsalva manoeuvre. However, at the age of 13 a severe gradient of 85 mm Hg was noted on Valsalva (Fig. b). At this time he was clearly in stage II. Because of the absence of severe symptoms and his very young age, a conservative strategy was chosen and follow-up was performed at a peripheral hospital.
At the age of 23, he was referred to the HCM outpatient clinic of the Erasmus Medical Center with palpitations and syncope. At that time his echocardiogram showed an MWT of 30 mm, with normal systolic function and absence of LVOTO. Based on the presence of a positive family history for SCD, massive hypertrophy and syncope, he received an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. At the age of 28 he experienced his first appropriate ICD shock due to fast ventricular tachycardia (VT) at 214/min. At age 30 genetic testing revealed a pathogenic missense mutation in myosin heavy chain (MYH7;c.3133C > T;p.Arg1045Cys). At age 32 he experienced inappropriate ICD shocks caused by an isolation defect of the ICD lead, which was then replaced. At age 33 he experienced two further appropriate ICD shocks for fast VT.
Over 20 years of echocardiographic follow-up there was a gradual decrease in MWT, LVEF and LVOT gradient, and a gradual increase in LA diameter, LV end-diastolic dimension and LV end-systolic dimension (Figs. and ), suggesting progression from stage II to stage III. At age 33 the patient experienced his first episode of fluid retention leading to congestive HF. His LVEF is currently 25% and he is on a regimen of beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, loop diuretics, MRAs and amiodarone. He is in stage IV and NYHA class III, without signs of fluid retention, and has been referred to the cardiac transplantation programme. Thus far there have been no episodes of AF.","

CR_ENG_34,English,"A 73-year-old frail woman with extensive comorbidities, including rheumatic heart disease (status post mechanical aortic and mitral valve replacement for which she was on warfarin therapy), nonischemic cardiomyopathy and chronic atrial fibrillation (status post implantable cardiac resynchronization therapy), a history of cerebral haemorrhage, type II diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, congestive heart failure, and peripheral artery disease, presented with a 1-month history of progressive, debilitating bilateral thigh muscle weakness (left more than right) and left lower extremity pain, which caused difficulty in walking and arising from a seated position. She also endorsed intermittent symptoms of bilateral lower extremity rest pain and claudication. The patient remained hemodynamically stable and afebrile throughout her hospital stay. On physical examination, she had significant muscle atrophy (bilateral thigh and calf muscles) and reproducible pain with active and passive movements of her left hip muscles. Her calf and leg compartments were soft bilaterally, although with focal tenderness along the left lateral thigh. A lesser degree of tenderness was present on the right lateral thigh. Her sensory exam was limited due to her baseline diabetic neuropathy and peripheral artery disease.
The patient underwent an extensive diagnostic workup, which demonstrated significant metabolic derangements of unclear etiology. Notably, her relevant laboratory abnormalities included persistent leukocytosis in the 19,000 white blood cell/mcL range, rise in her creatinine from 1.1 to 1.4 mg/dL, potassium of 4.7 mEq/L, lactate of 1.9 mg/dL, creatinine kinase of >1000 U/L, an erythrocyte sedimentation rate of 80 mm/hr, C-reactive protein of 117 mg/L, and procalcitonin of 0.28 ng/mL.
The neurology service was initially consulted to assess her bilateral lower extremity pain and weakness and concluded that her clinical picture was inconsistent with a neuropathic process. Given a family history of systemic lupus erythematosus, the rheumatology service was then consulted to assess for the possibility of inflammatory myositis or vasculitis. Their initial impression was that of possible inflammatory myositis, and they recommended a muscle tissue biopsy for further evaluation.
With the diagnosis still unclear, the emergency surgery service was next consulted to rule out lower extremity compartment syndrome; suspicion for this was low in the presence of soft calf and leg compartments. At this point, the patient underwent abdominal and pelvic CT angiography (CTA), which demonstrated a 7.6 × 3.9 cm intramuscular hematoma within the left iliacus muscle, without evidence of active extravasation (Figures and ). Also noted were severe, diffuse multifocal atherosclerotic plaque throughout the abdominal aorta and iliac arteries, an ostial occlusion of the right superficial femoral artery (SFA), and a midsegment left SFA occlusion. Her ankle brachial indices were determined to be 0.55 on the right and 0.53 on the left, consistent with aortobi-iliac and bilateral femoral artery occlusive disease. The vascular surgery service was then consulted due to these findings and persistent diagnostic confusion. After consideration of the patient's progressive and ongoing symptoms, imaging findings, and history of anticoagulation use, she was diagnosed with iliacus compartment syndrome, a rare and underappreciated entity, causing femoral nerve ischemia in the setting of large iliac sheath hematoma.
Given ongoing and progressive symptoms of unilateral left lower leg weakness and pain, the patient was taken urgently for open surgical retroperitoneal exploration. The left iliac sheath was exposed after developing the retroperitoneal plane through a modified left flank (Gibson's) incision. The iliacus fascia was found to be tensely expanded on inspection and palpation. A fasciotomy was carried out by sharply incising the fascia in both a cranial and caudal direction, and approximately 500 cc of dark-coloured, gelatinous thrombus was evacuated. No specific site of bleeding was identified during surgery (nor on preoperative CTA). The evacuated hematoma space was copiously irrigated, and drains were placed in both the subfascial cavity and the left lateral retroperitoneal gutter.
The operative procedure and postoperative course were uncomplicated. The patient reported early improvement in leg pain on postoperative day 1 and slow return of left leg hip flexion motor function by postoperative day 2. Given her complicated medical history, she remained on the cardiology service for 2 additional weeks for medical management of her congestive heart failure and optimization of her anticoagulation. She continued to work with physical therapy while in-hospital and was eventually discharged to a rehabilitation facility for further recovery. At discharge, she was doing well and with significant improvement of her left leg motor function.","

CR_ENG_36,English,"A 65-year-old female presented with complaints of gross hematuria and lower abdominal pain. She denied flank pain, dysuria, urinary urgency or frequency, unexplained weight loss, or fatigue. Past medical history included cervical intraepithelial neoplasia III and endometrial hyperplasia, for which she received a fractional dilatation and curettage and complete conization. Although she had quit a decade before presentation, the patient had a 70.5 pack-year smoking history. Physical examination was unremarkable. A complete metabolic panel and blood count with differential were normal. Repeat Pap smear and vaginosis screen were negative. Cancer antigen 125 was normal at 13 U/mL. Urine analysis with microscopic examination revealed 3+ red blood cells, 2+ protein, normal white blood cells, and no bacteria. Urine cytology was suspicious for malignancy of the urothelium. Fluorescence in situ hybridization testing was negative.
We obtained a CT urogram with three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction, which demonstrated a 3.6 × 2.0 cm heterogeneous mass originating from the right pelvic kidney with associated dilation of the proximal renal collecting system (). Imaging could not discern whether the mass originated from the renal parenchyma or the urothelium. Cystourethroscopy showed a normal-appearing urethra, bladder, and ureteral orifices. Retrograde pyelogram revealed a normal ureter and pelvicaliceal system on the left, but a pelvic kidney with a single, normal ureter and mildly dilated pelvicaliceal system with poor filling of the renal pelvis on the right. The hilum of the pelvic kidney was facing left. To examine vascular supply, a CT angiogram was obtained (). A single renal artery originated from the proximal right common iliac artery just distal to the aortic bifurcation, whereas a single renal vein emptied into the left common iliac vein bifurcation (). Biopsy of the mass was not attempted before surgery.
A robot-assisted laparoscopic nephroureterectomy was performed based on the clinical workup strongly suggesting malignancy of the urothelium. The pelvic kidney was at the level of the sacral promontory, which required robotic port placement slightly cranial to the standard pelvic surgery. Therefore, a 12-mm ENDOPATH (Ethicon, Somerville, NJ) port was placed four fingerbreadths above the umbilicus. An 8-mm robotic port was placed five fingerbreadths lateral to the camera on the right side above the line of the umbilicus. A 15-mm port was placed in the right iliac fossa, whereas an 8-mm was placed in the left. An 8-mm left robotic port was placed four fingerbreadths lateral to the camera port cranial to the umbilical line ().
The ectopic kidney was found hanging by the aortic bifurcation. The peritoneum was incised along the right external iliac artery and traced proximally. Dissection was carried proximally around the bifurcation and then down the left common iliac vessels. A single renal artery originating from the proximal right common iliac artery was identified. A large renal vein draining into the left common iliac vein was found and prompted further dissection for better identification. A second smaller renal vein was found emptying into the inferior vena cava. A sufficient segment of the right renal artery was freed and then stapled with a 45 mm load. The main renal vein emptying to the left common iliac vein was then stapled in a similar manner. The right-sided accessory vein was then clipped. The kidney was lifted off the iliac vessels and attention was shifted to the ureter.
The ureter was traced to the ureterovesical junction and a cuff of the urinary bladder was excised. The opening in the bladder was sutured using 2-0 V-Loc (Covidien, New Haven, CT) and a hemostatic agent was placed after removing the specimen. Estimated blood loss was 20 mL. There were no postoperative complications.
The final pathology revealed a 3.8 cm tumor of the renal pelvis that was a high-grade, invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma with focal glandular differentiation (tubules, signet right cells, and mucin). The tumor extended through the muscularis propria of the renal pelvis, invading into the renal parenchyma. The patient subsequently underwent three cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy with methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin, and cisplatin. The patient remains healthy without reoccurrence 18 months after her nephroureterectomy.","

CR_ENG_37,English,"A 45-year-old female Asian nurse with a history of well-controlled hyperthyroidism presented at the emergency room with a sudden onset of dysarthria and paralysis at the weekend. She complained of feeling ill a week before the first visit but had been able to go about her daily life and work. Physical examination revealed a fever over 38.0 °C, altered mental status (13 points on Glasgow coma scale), drop of the right mouth, and paralysis of the right upper and lower extremity. She had not received dental or surgical procedures for one year before the visit.
presents our patient’s laboratory data at the first visit. While hemoglobin and platelet count were slightly low, white blood cell count was normal (). The prothrombin time (PT) was slightly prolonged, and the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) was within the normal range. Renal and liver function tests were normal. Lactate dehydrogenase and C-reactive protein levels were elevated. The leukocyte fraction and the other coagulation tests could not be carried out in our hospital due to it being the weekend. Unfortunately, the clinical laboratory technicians who usually observe blood cells professionally were not available during the weekend.
Computed tomography (CT) of the head did not show any abnormal findings including an early CT sign. The magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) detected a high-signal-intensity change in her left brain, which indicated M1 occlusion (A,B). Electrocardiography showed normal sinus rhythm. An echocardiogram revealed a vegetation-like structure on her atrial valve. We strongly suspected infectious endocarditis (IE) complicated by cerebral embolism. Therefore, a blood culture was taken immediately, and empirical antibiotics were administered. Anticoagulation therapy was commenced concurrently, and our neurosurgeons decided to perform an endovascular thrombectomy. The blood clot was successfully removed (C insert), leading to rapid and complete reperfusion (C). Soon after, the level of her consciousness improved, and she was admitted into the department of neurosurgery at our hospital.
However, six hours after the endovascular thrombectomy, the level of her consciousness worsened markedly again, and computed tomography revealed massive intracranial hemorrhage around the stroke area. We judged the clinical diagnosis of brain death on the next day, and she died on the fourth hospital day. Regardless of suspecting IE, no bacteria were found in the thrombus obtained from the cerebral artery, and these blood cultures were negative. At the time of her death, leukemia cells were first reported in the peripheral blood () after the weekend. The abnormal leukocytes had abundant azure granules, strong nuclear irregularities, and many Auer bodies (, arrow) in the peripheral blood. A pathological autopsy was performed shortly after death with written informed consent from the patient’s family.","

CR_ENG_38,English,"A 47-year-old African American male with stage III cutaneous T-cell lymphoma with large cell transformation presented to the hospital with shortness of breath, fatigue, and failure to thrive. The patient had progressed through multiple lines of chemotherapy including EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin), romidepsin, gemcitabine, brentuximab, and pralatrexate. At inpatient presentation, he had malignant pleural effusions, hypercalcemia, and leukocytosis with eosinophilia. Given the patient’s rapidly worsening clinical course, it was decided to start ifosfamide, carboplatin, and etoposide (ICE) chemotherapy with etoposide 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3, ifosfamide 5000 mg/ on day 2 infused over 24 hours, and carboplatin with an area under curve (AUC) of 5 on day 3. He was alert and oriented prior to and during the infusion but became delirious on day 3 of the regimen, 6 hours after the completion of the ifosfamide infusion. Physical examination did not reveal any stereotypical movements or twitching. His mental status worsened from initial agitation and confusion to drowsiness and eventually stupor. Diagnostic evaluation for acute mental status change including complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic panel, ammonia level, and computed tomography scan of the head was negative. Infectious workup including blood cultures, urine culture, and chest X-ray did not reveal any infectious process contributing to the altered mental status. Thus, the patient’s acute altered mental status was attributed to IME. He was started on hydration, and 50 mg of intravenous MB was given every 4 hours. His mental status began to improve 16 hours after start of MB and was back to his baseline after 48 hours of treatment (received 12 total doses). The one cycle of ICE chemotherapy temporarily improved his disease but due to neurotoxicity, he was not rechallenged.","

CR_ENG_39,English,"A 53-year-old male with no concomitant disease observed a hard, painless mass at the pelvis for about four months. He consulted his general practitioner, who referred him to a regional hospital. The X-ray and CT scan showed a large gluteal chondrogenic mass originating from the right posterior iliac wing (Fig. ). The lesion did not affect the iliosacral joint or sciatic nerve. A CT-guided biopsy revealed nonspecific chondrogenic tissue. The patient was referred to our hospital for further evaluation. After review of the patient charts, a low-grade chondrosarcoma, most likely secondary to previous unknown osteochondroma, was found. No metastasis was present in the subsequent staging examinations.
The origin of the lesion was close the posterior superior iliac spine (PSIS). The ilium itself was not invaded by the tumor. For better stability of the pelvic ring, tumor excision was planned at its base at the PSIS, preserving the tabula interna of the ilium and the sacroiliac joint. The pelvis including the tumor was printed out as a 3-D model for detailed preoperative planning of the freehand osteotomy (Fig. ).
During surgery, the patient was placed in a lateral position and the skin incision started at the distal end of the sacrum, following the PSIS and the iliac crest up to the ASIS. The gluteal muscles were dissected from the iliac bone from proximally to distally, preserving the superior gluteal neurovascular bundle. As planned on the 3-D model, the chisel was guided from below the PSIS posteriorly to between the iliac cortices anteriorly. The tumor was resected en bloc (Fig. ), and the gluteal muscles were reattached.
The postoperative histologic work up revealed a low-grade chondrosarcoma (grade (G) 1), resected with adequate margins. Since most of the resected specimen included soft tissues and the resection margins were not specifically calculated preoperatively, no precision was calculated using a postoperative CT scan. The patient was mobilized with crutches and full weight-bearing. At the last follow-up, 7 months postoperatively, the patient was able to ambulate without crutches and without a limp. In the MRI of the pelvis and CT of the chest, no further disease was detected.","

CR_ENG_40,English,"In this report, we present a 26-year-old male with a past medical history of Behcet's disease who developed progressive vision loss and severe hypotonia. He had received 15 mg of methotrexate weekly and 7.5 mg of prednisolone daily as well as multiple injections of subtenon triamcinolone acetonide (TA; 40 mg). He had also undergone phacoemulsification and posterior chamber intraocular lens placement for cataract in his both eyes. Pars plana vitrectomy with silicone oil injection was performed in his right eye for hypotony. Visual acuity was 20/400 in his right eye and “hand motion” in his left eye. Ocular hypotony persisted despite all these treatments in the absence of active inflammation. Corneal folds and band keratopathy were noted after few weeks. Fundus was poorly visible but it was remarkable for cystic changes in the macular region. B-scan showed a significant serous choroidal detachment due to severe hypotony in both eyes. To increase the IOP, multiple injections of 40 mg of subtenon and 4 mg of intravitreal TA were administered; however, no improvement was observed in vision, IOP status, and serous choroidal detachment. Visual acuity deteriorated because of persistent hypotony maculopathy. Ibopamine (a dopamine agonist) eye drops were used for three months with an increase in IOP of 2 mm Hg in both the eyes, but no change in vision was detected.
We discussed the details of our experimental treatment based on published studies with the patient and proceeded with the treatment after obtaining a written consent. Subsequently, high-dose latanoprost eye drops (XALATAN, 0.005%, Pfizer) were administered every 6 hours in both eyes.
One month later, IOP increased to 4 mm Hg, and at two months, to 7 mm Hg. After two months of latanoprost treatment, we performed a drug rechallenge test by discontinuing latanoprost for four weeks and then resuming the drug to prove its effect on IOP. After 6 months, IOP was stable at 7 mm Hg and remained unchanged even after 24 months. B-scan showed significant improvement in hypotony maculopathy and fluid resolved subretinally (Figures 1B and D). The patient's vision improved to 20/200 in his right eye and “finger counting” at 1.5 m in his left eye.","

CR_ENG_41,English,"A previously healthy 2-year-old girl contracted influenza and developed epigastric pain and tarry stools. H2-blockers, PPI and enterokinesis activators were commenced elsewhere. Two weeks later, she was referred to us for intractable vomiting and epigastric pain. There was no family history of peptic ulcer. Abdominal radiology was suggestive of pyloric obstruction but ultrasonography showed a normal pylorus. On barium meal, there was no passage of barium from the stomach to the duodenum and the stomach was distended with increased peristalsis. On endoscopy, the antrum was so narrowed circumferentially that the endoscope could not be passed through, but surprisingly, the mucosa was normal without scarring (Fig. ). Serum gastrin was normal, and serology and biopsies for H pylori were negative. Imaging analyses and laparoscopic investigation revealed no obvious compression from surrounding organs. Endoscopic balloon dilatation was performed twice without improvement so surgery was planned. At laparotomy, gastrotomy was performed transversely over the antrum just proximal to the stricture and the lesion delivered through the incision (Fig. ). The mucosa was incised circumferentially 5 mm proximal to the antral stricture and dissected free from underlying fibrotic scar tissue which was then excised with great care to not perforate the gastric wall. After excising the fibrotic tissue, the stricture was released and the antrum expanded nicely. The mucosa, submucosa, and healthy muscle layers were then approximated (Fig. ). An endoscopic finding 6 months after surgery, no stricture is seen (Fig. ).","

CR_ENG_42,English,"A 16-year-old female attended to the Department of Endodontics at Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Iran, with the chief complaint of periodic swelling and pus drainage from mandibular anterior region. She reported no pain and traumatic accident in this area and her past medical history was not contributory. Extra-oral examination showed non-palpable lymph nodes and no facial swelling. Intra-oral examination showed a sinus tract in the alveolar mucosa adjacent to tooth #25. Tooth decay in proximal surfaces of tooth #24 were seen and periodontal pocket was absent. Thermal and electrical vitality tests were performed for all mandibular incisors including #24 and 25 which did not elicit responses in latter teeth. Also, grade I mobility was identified in tooth #25 with tenderness on palpation in adjacent mucosa. All anterior mandibular teeth were painless on percussion testing. A periapical radiography indicated a large unilocular well-defined radiolucency surrounding mandibular incisors with a single tracing gutta-percha (). Also, radiography showed diversion of central incisors roots. It was decided to perform root canal therapy on teeth #24 and 25. The tooth was anesthetized with 68 mg articaine 3% (Darou Pakhsh, Tehran, Iran) containing 0.017 mg epinephrine (1:80000) and isolated with rubber dam to prepare the access cavity with a round diamond bur (Dentsply, Maillefer, Ballaigues, Switzerland). After access cavity preparation and pulpal exposure on tooth #25, a suppurative yellowish fluid was drained through the cavity (). After discontinuation of the drainage, working length was determined, both lingual and buccal canals were prepared with crown down technique by #15-40 Flexo-File (Dentsply, Maillefer, Switzerland), followed by gentle irrigation with sodium hypochlorite (2.5% NaOCl) and normal saline. Subsequently, root canals were filled with calcium hydroxide powder (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) in combination with anesthetic solution as a paste using a lentulo ﬁller. The access cavities were sealed using 3 mm Cavit (ESPE, Seefeld, Germany). After 10 days, the dressing paste was irrigated by flushing with normal saline and teeth were asymptomatic. Root canals were repeatedly debrided and lateral condensation technique was used to obturate the canals with gutta-percha and AH-26 sealer (De Trey, Konstanz, Germany) (). The 3-, 12- and 18-month follow-ups indicated no sensitivity to palpation and percussion in clinical evaluations and radiographies showed evidence of developing bone regeneration ().","

CR_ENG_43,English,"A 20-year-old man suffered a severe crush injury of the pelvis with concomitant membranous urethral distraction injury. He underwent an attempt to posterior repair three months post-trauma using a perineal approach with bulbomembranous anastomosis. Inadvertently, the anastomosis was performed onto the posterior surface of the prostate. The prostatic apex was dislodged anteriorly (). As a result, the patient went into immediate retention after postoperative catheter removal. An anatomical midline dissection using a combined perineal and suprapubic approach was chosen six months after the previous attempt. Vessel and nerve sparing dissection was used preserving the rhabdosphincter. The bulbous urethra was completely mobilized via a midline perineal approach, excising all excess scar tissues. The retrograde blood supply of the urethral bulb via the dorsal penile vessels was still satisfactory. There was no visible connection to the proximal urethral end. The distal end of the membranous urethra can almost always be identified directly underneath the symphysis, just proximal to the divergence of the corpora cavernosa. Care should be taken not to damage the dorsal neurovascular bundle of the penis that runs behind a thin fascial sheet closer toward the symphysis. After identifying the rhabdosphincter intrasphincteric dissection is used. There is a fascial plane on the inner side of the rhabdosphincter allowing for lengthwise sliding of the urethral wall. This plane allows for careful dissection (). The mobilized bulbous urethra was now pulled through the rhabdosphincter. It was not possible to find the proximal urethral end within severe scar tissue. Through a lower midline laparotomy the bladder outlet and prostate was explored. Endoscopy through the site of the suprapubic catheter revealed that the prostatic apex was dislodged anteriorly right behind the symphysis pubis. Here the prostatic urethra was opened. No mobilization of the bladder or the remains of the prostate was possible above the pelvic floor. Through the perineal incision the proximal corpora cavernosa were dissected in the midline, again making sure not to damage the dorsal neurovascular bundle of the penis behind. This manoeuvre allows for the short cut needed to pull through the fully mobilized bulbopenile urethra into the small pelvis. A tension-free end-to-end anastomosis was now done intrapelvically very similar to the vesicourethral anastomosis after radical prostatectomy. A size 16 French transurethral catheter with longitudinal grooves was inserted. The patency of the anastomosis was checked by injecting saline solution alongside the catheter. No drain was used followed by layered wound closure. The transurethral catheter was left in situ for three weeks. Tadalafil 5mg per day was given to optimize penile rehabilitation for 6 months. Half a year after definitive repair the patient is acceptably continent using one safety pad per day (). Furthermore he has erections enough for masturbation and orgasm, although not enough for penetration.","

CR_ENG_44,English,"Our patient is a SCD patient, a boy aged 8 years, living in São Paulo, Brazil. He met all eligibility criteria to undergo HSCT () [, , , ].
He had an ischemic stroke, the major cause of morbidity in SCD [], at 8 months of age, without motor or sensory sequelae, showing only mild cognitive impairment. He has been under treatment with monthly blood transfusions since the ischemic event. As a complication of SCD, he exhibited a splenic sequestration crisis and underwent splenectomy at the age of three years.
After seven years of monthly transfusion program, he presented an iron overload, with heart disease and mild diastolic congestive heart failure. Even though these blood transfusions have prevented neurologic events, they have brought about significant end-organ toxicity in this patient. This was expected [], since generally after 2 years regular blood transfusion therapy causes overload of iron side effects [, ].
The clinical and laboratory features supported HSCT indication, and the patient has an HLA-matched sister (10 × 10). Postponing his transplant could lead to increased cardiac involvement, which would increase the morbidity of BMT.
His sister, a girl aged 1 year and 5 months, was identified as a possible donor. She was evaluated by two different pediatricians, one from the Hematology Department at Hospital Israelita Albert Einstein and the second pediatrician from another hospital, the Child Cancer Institute (Hospital das Clínicas, Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo, USP). After these evaluations, the sister was released for donation.
For HSCT, bone marrow donation may be performed by surgical harvesting of the bone marrow or by apheresis collection. The patient's surgical harvesting has the benefit of lower risk of graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) after transplantation [].
To perform the surgical harvesting, it would be necessary to collect a volume equivalent to 15 ml/kg of the recipient patient, in order to achieve the sufficient amount of progenitor cells, minimizing the risk of graft failure. In the literature, there is a recommendation that each collection does not exceed the maximum volume of 20 ml/kg of the donor [, ].
In this case, the patient weighs 26 kg and his sister weighs 9 kg. Thus, it would be necessary for the procedure for bone marrow donation to be carried out 2 or 3 times, in order to reach the sufficient quantity of cells to HSCT [, ].
Bone marrow collection could be performed under general anesthesia through multiple punctures to the posterior iliac crest, with low risk of severe adverse events [, , ].
As this donor is compatible with her brother (here reported) and her sister, both diagnosed with sickle cell anemia and indicated a bone marrow transplant, we decided to collect the 20 ml/kg donor volume to maintain a fraction stored for future transplantation of sister, reducing the need for additional collections.
These considerations led to the consultation of the Bioethical Committee of the hospital as follows.","

CR_ENG_45,English,"A twenty-eight-year-old man, weighing 70kg and 175cm in height, was brought to the
Emergency Department at the Hospital Universitario San Vicente
Fundación in Medellin, Colombia. He arrived one and a half hours
after drinking an unknown amount of organophosphorus pesticide during a suicide
attempt. On admission, gastric lavage and activated charcoal were given promptly.
Initially, he had miosis, bronchorrhea, frequent urination, a heart rate of 110
beats per minute and a blood pressure of 109/65mmHg. To counteract the cholinergic
syndrome, a bolus of 1mg of atropine was administered i.v., followed by additional
boluses every 5 minutes until the patient's condition was stabilized. A total amount
of 37mg of atropine was used to achieve a reduction of secretions and respiratory
distress. An electrocardiogram showed sinus tachycardia with prolongation of the
corrected QT interval (520ms). A few hours later, the patient had a dramatic
decrease in carbon dioxide removal, attaining a partial arterial pressure of carbon
dioxide of 57mmHg and a blood pH of 7.08, which suggested acute respiratory
acidosis. At this moment, the acetylcholinesterase enzyme (AChE) activity in red
blood cells was 2.44% (0.0219 ∆pH/hour). The prolonged altered mental status plus an
oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) < 60mmHg prompted the admission of the
patient into the intensive care unit (ICU), where he was intubated. Midazolam and
fentanyl were intravenously administered during the first 24 hours as sedatives. On
arrival to the ICU, the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II (APACHE)
score was 34. The time to start the spontaneous breathing test was defined by
clinical expertise plus the results of measurements of several ventilatory signals
used as classical predictors (i.e., work of breathing - WOB), but the lack of any of
the following previous conditions was assessed: hypoxemia, mental status, cardiac
arrhythmia and respiratory distress. The patient was ventilated in spontaneous mode
during each weaning test, with a positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) level of
5cmH2O, pressure support of 7cmH2O and fraction of
inspired oxygen (FiO2) of 40%.
The first weaning was attempted on the second day. The patient initially tolerated
the test but showed miosis and bronchorrhea (poisoning symptoms) shortly thereafter;
therefore, the patient could not be extubated. The plasma AChE activity was 447U/L
(9.60%). On the eleventh day, the patient did not tolerate a second spontaneous
breathing test, showing signs of agitation and respiratory distress. The AChE
activity remained reduced, with a value of 1,646U/L (35.3%). On the thirteenth day,
a third unsuccessful attempt at extubation was performed, but 48 hours later, the
patient showed a PaO2 < 60mmHg, a carbon dioxide partial pressure
(PaCO2) of 72mmHg and a PaO2/FiO2 ratio of 104,
which required re-intubation. A plasma AChE of 3,818U/L (79.8%) was observed.
Finally, a successful fourth weaning test was performed on the seventeenth day; the
plasma AChE activity was 4,370U/L (93.8%), and the PaO2 and
PaCO2 reached permissible values, 80mmHg and 43mmHg, respectively.
After extubation, the patient was discharged from the ICU.
shows the following ventilatory
function parameters used as classical predictors of weaning. The median of the WOB
minimally decreased from 0.39J/L to 0.26J/L between the first and last weaning
attempts, respectively. Regarding rapid shallow breathing (RSB), all of the values
incorrectly suggested that all weaning tests were likely to be successful (RSB <
100).
summarizes the squared Pearson
correlation coefficients (R2) between muscles and between patient and
machine, and the ratio between energy in high and low frequencies (RHL). The
R2 indicates the grade of linear correlation between muscles or
between patient and machine in each weaning test. Values of RHL higher than 250
were observed for the external intercostal (Extint) and in the three muscles
during the first and second weaning attempts, respectively, which could be
attributed to an increase in the activity of respiratory muscles. Regarding the
synchronization between pairs of muscles and the machine-patient, different
muscle coordination levels were observed. In fact, a variable and low
correlation coefficient was determined between the first and third weaning
tests, which suggested poor synchronization in the first weaning test between
the diaphragm (Dia) - sternocleidomastoid (Strn) and diaphragm-external
intercostal. In contrast, the paired airway pressures (Paw)-Extint
and Paw-Strn showed better synchronization. This result suggests that
accessory respiratory muscles (external intercostal and sternocleidomastoid)
were more engaged than the diaphragm was. During the second and third attempts,
there was an increase in muscle coordination between the diaphragm and the other
two muscles, despite the low correlation coefficient between muscles and airway
pressure showing lower machine-patient engagement.
illustrates the surface
electromyography (sEMG) signal of the patient's muscles in the inspiratory and
expiratory phase during the spontaneous breathing test. During the second
weaning attempt (), there was no
contraction in any recorded muscle; in contrast, the muscle activity increased
in the third attempt ().
Ultimately, the successful weaning was mainly characterized by improved
correlations between the diaphragm-sternocleidomastoid and the paired
Paw-Dia (). In the
fourth attempt, the highest correlation coefficient was for Paw-Dia,
which was associated with a proper response of the machine to the patient's
muscle effort. Thus, as shown in ,
the diaphragm muscle appears to play a more significant role in mechanical
ventilation in comparison to the external intercostal and sternocleidomastoid
muscles.","

CR_ENG_46,English,"A 15-year-old previously healthy young female presented to the emergency department of our tertiary care institute with a 7-day history of high-grade fever, painful neck swelling, dry cough and progressive breathlessness. She also had history of vestibulitis of nose prior to onset of fever, but there was no history of chest pain, hemoptysis and orthopnea. On evaluation, she was febrile (100.4°F) with pulse-110/min, respiratory rate-30/min, blood pressure-100/60 mmHg and saturation at room air-86%. Her physical examination showed pallor, with taut and tender neck muscles. Small multiple tender cervical lymph nodes were also noticed. The oropharynx was normal and there was no evidence of parapharyngeal or retropharyngeal abscess on examination. Chest examination showed bilateral crepitation with reduced vesicular breath sounds on both bases. Central nervous system evaluation revealed left lateral rectus muscle palsy. Cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems were unremarkable clinically. Her initial investigations showed a total leukocyte count of 16,400 cs/mm (neutrophils 85%, lymphocytes 15%), hemoglobin-8.5 gm% and platelet count-35,000 cs/mm, with normocytic normochromic blood film morphology. The clinical chemistry was unremarkable, except mild hypoalbuminemia. Chest X-ray showed evidence of right lower zone consolidation and pleural effusion []. In view of the above findings, an immediate possibility of neck vein thrombosis was considered and a contrast-enhanced CT and ultrasound Doppler of the neck were obtained, which showed left internal jugular venous thrombosis with multiple enlarged lymph nodes and subcutaneous edema []. A contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain was performed to localize the cause of left sixth nerve palsy, which revealed an area of nonenhancement in the left cavernous sinus suggestive of thrombosis []. A 2D-echocardiography was carried out to rule out infective endocarditis, which was also normal. Pleural fluid analysis showed neutrophilic predominant exudate with low glucose values and growth consisting of gram negative bacilli, identical in characteristics with Fusobacterium. She was initially being put on broad-spectrum i.v. antibiotics like augmentin and metrogyl, which was changed in concordance with culture sensitivity results to meropenem, levofloxacin and teicoplanin. All other cultures including blood, sputum, urine and stool were sterile. Right empyema thoracis was drained but, in view of multiloculated collection, it also required intrapleural streptokinase instillation. The patient was continued on the above antibiotics along with oxygen supplementation and supportive treatment in the form of anticoagulants to which she responded dramatically and there was rapid improvement in the general condition of the patient. Anticoagulation was not given initially due to thrombocytopenia but, because the response to antibiotics was slow, anticoagulants were added in the form of low molecular weight heparin once her platelet count was above 75,000/mm3. She responded very well to the treatment and improved clinically as well as radiologically, with resolution of consolidation and effusion on serial chest X-rays. Anticogulation was given for a total duration of 4 weeks and antibiotics were continued for a total of 6 weeks. Follow-up Doppler neck showed no evidence of residual internal jugular venous thrombosis. The patient has now recovered completely and is being followed-up in out-patient department on a regular basis for the last 6 months.","

CR_ENG_47,English,"A 25-year-old G1 P0 5′ 7′′ woman had a LMP and an early second trimester ultrasound that firmly established her EDC. At conception, she weighed around 150 lbs (estimated BMI 24). However, she had gained 35 pounds by 37 weeks estimated gestational age, and measured 3-4 cm size > dates during several visits in her mid third trimester. Her one-hour 50 gm glucola challenge test was 98 and her third trimester hemoglobin was 10.8 gms/dl. Her ULOTDcpd was calculated to be 41 weeks 0 days − 10 days = 39 w 4 days (6 days for excessive weight gain and 4 days for size > dates). However, between 37 and 38 weeks gestation, she gained over 4 lbs and was noted to have a modest elevation of her blood pressure (132/90, 128/86). Due to the combination of impending CPD and impending pre-eclampsia, she was scheduled for preventive induction at 38 weeks and 2 days estimated gestational age.
She presented to the hospital on the evening prior to her delivery, and her fetus was noted to have a vertex presentation. Her cervix was 1 cm dilated, 25% effaced and −3 station. Following placement of an IV and the documentation of a reactive NST, she received a single dose of dinoprostone per vagina (10 mg pleget) at 10 pm. Uterine contractions started just before 5 am. Her contractions became stronger over the next few hours, and the dinoprostone was removed at 8 am. Her cervical exam was unchanged. One hour after the dinoprostone was removed, a pitocin drip was added to maintain and further augment her contractions. Cervical change started to occur about three hours later, that is, around noontime. Several hours later, she was noted to be 5 cm dilated, and epidural analgesia was started. At around 9 pm, she experienced spontaneous rupture of membranes, producing clear amniotic fluid. Cervical exam at that time revealed 6 cm dilatation, 80% effaced and −1 station. She was completely dilated 2-3 hours later. She made steady progress with pushing, and her blood pressure remained within normal limits. Although her second stage lasted just over three hours, she finally delivered a 7 lb 8 ounce infant spontaneously over a small 1st degree perineal tear. Her estimated blood loss was initially 400 cc's, but she had additional bleeding about a half an hour after delivery due to moderate uterine atony. She required external uterine massage, one dose of IM methergine and additional IV pitocin. Her postpartum hemoglobin was 9.6 mg/dl. Her baby's APGAR scores were 8 at 1 minute and 9 at 5 minutes, and it had an unremarkable normal nursery course. Both the mother and her infant were discharged to home on the second postpartum day in good condition.
We believe that, had she been allowed to gestate past 40 week gestation, she would have had a baby weighing eight pounds or more and would have probably required a cesarean delivery for second stage arrest of labor. This belief is largely due to the prolonged second stage that she experienced and the fact that babies in the late third trimester usually grow 4–6 oz/week [, ].","

CR_ENG_48,English,"A 20-year-old lady presented to our hospital with complaints of intermittent abdominal pain for 20 days which was diffuse, colicky in nature, nonradiating, and associated with multiple episodes of vomiting. She also had burning and tingling sensation of the bilateral lower limbs since 3–5 days. There was no history of fever, burning micturition, or menstrual abnormalities. She was previously evaluated elsewhere for similar complaints episodically over the last 6 months, where she underwent USG Abdomen and CECT Abdomen, which were not contributory, and the diagnosis was inconclusive. She had high blood pressure recordings (BP) on admission (BP-160/100 mm Hg). She was initially admitted to the wards and was being evaluated for pain in the abdomen. On day 2, she had an episode of generalized tonic–clonic seizure (GTCS) in the ward followed by post-ictal state. She was transferred to the MICU for further observation and management.
Immediately on arrival to MICU, she had one more episode of GTCS which was terminated by Inj. Lorazepam, and she was administered a loading dose of inj. leviteracetam. She was initiated on IV Labetalol infusion in view of persistent hypertension (IABP recordings > 200/120 mm Hg). She underwent MRI Brain which was suggestive of PRES and also revealed sub-ependymal heterotopia (). Interictal electroencephalogram was suggestive of moderate encephalopathy. In view of the persistently high BP recordings and seizures in the background of unexplained pain abdomen, possibility of porphyria was considered, and spot urine porphobilinogen was sent. Qualitative spot urine porphobilinogen test was positive. She was initiated on 25% dextrose infusion and high carbohydrate (glucose) diet. She also had intermittent episodes of irritability and agitation possibly suggestive of neuro-visceral symptoms that were managed with benzodiazepines. Her 24 hours urine porphobilinogen(PBG) levels (44.5 mg/24 hours) (normal: <2.5 mg/24 hours) and 24 hours urinary amino levulinic acid levels (77.7 mg/day) (normal: 0.25–6.5 mg/24 hours) were significantly elevated. She was initiated on Tab. Gabapentin in view of features suggestive of neuropathic pain in bilateral lower limbs. She was managed with antiepileptics (leviteracetam), antihypertensive medications (metoprolol, amlodipine, and clonidine), and benzodiazepines (clonazepam).
On day 8, in view of persistent abdominal pain and neuro-visceral symptoms, she was initiated on Inj Hematin (4 mg/kg). She received a total of four doses of Inj. Hematin. Nerve conduction studies were negative for peripheral neuropathy. Serum/plasma, urine, and fecal porphyrin levels could not be evaluated due to non-availability of the investigations in the institution and allied labs. Genetic testing of the patient and her siblings and family members was advised for confirmation of gene mutation.
She had shown clinical improvement in terms of colicky abdominal pain, neuropsychiatric symptoms, symptoms suggestive of peripheral neuropathy, and hypertension by day 10. Her antihypertensive medications were optimized. The patient was advised optimization of antiepileptic medications with tapering doses of Leviteracetam and continuation of Briveracetam in view of increased incidence of psychosis associated with Leviteracetam. She was discharged on day 14 with advice to undergo genetic testing. Genetic testing revealed mutation in the gene coding for hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS), which leads to development of AIP ().","

CR_ENG_50,English,"A 54 year old female patient reported to our department with the chief complaint of pain and swelling in the right lower back region of the jaw since three months ago. Initially, the patient developed pain in the teeth in the fourth quadrant of the jaw, followed by a localized swelling. Within one month, the teeth became mobile and were extracted, however the swelling persisted and grew progressively. The patient had no contributing medical history however she had a habit of quid chewing two to three times per day since 20 years ago.
General physical examination of the patient revealed signs of anemia with pale conjunctiva and nail beds. There was a gross facial asymmetry with diffuse swelling involving middle and lower third of the right side of the face extending from ala-tragus line to approximately four centimeters beyond the inferior border of the mandible (Figures 1 and ). The swelling extended anteriorly to the angle of the mouth and posteriorly to the posterior border of the ramus of the mandible. On palpation, two swellings were appreciated. One swelling which was extending from ala-tragus line to the inferior border of the mandible was fixed. The other swelling extended below the inferior cortex, ovoid in shape and measured approximately four centimeters in diameter. Both of the swellings were tender and firm in consistency. The condyle of the mandible on the same side was not palpable, while the jaw was deviated to the right on opening and closing the mouth (). The bilateral submandibular lymph nodes were palpable, tender, firm in consistency and not fixed. Intraorally, vestibular obliteration was seen extending from the canine to the anterior border of the ramus, posteriorly. The extraction socket distal to the second premolar showed erythematous granular mass covered partly with necrotic slough (). There was no obvious relation between the mandibular mass and the overlying mucosa. On palpation, the findings of inspection were confirmed, while the swelling was tender and indurated with no cortical expansion. First and second premolars were vertically compressible into their sockets. Considering the aggressive nature and the extension of the growth, carcinoma of the right mandibular alveolus and intraosseous carcinoma were considered in the differential diagnosis.
Panoramic radiograph revealed gross destruction of the right body and ramus of the mandible extending from the right lower canine to the mandibular notch with bay and promontory appearance of the margins. Right lower premolars showed floating tooth appearance with few radiopaque flecks of bone scattered within the lesion (). Posterior-anterior radiograph of mandible showed involvement of both medial and lateral cortical plates (). A screening chest radiograph was made to rule out any primary lesion in the lungs however, nothing abnormal was found.
CT scan was performed to know the extension of the lesion. It revealed a destructive lesion in the right half of the mandible extending from subcondylar to right parasymphyseal region. It showed a unicentric lesion with inside out growth and permeative type of destruction. The margins were indistinct with wide zone of transition suggesting an intraosseous malignant neoplasm. Masseter and part of pterygoid muscle was bulky suggesting infiltration. CT scan also showed a large oval well-defined submandibular mass with central necrosis suggestive of metastatic submandibular lymph node ().
High resolution ultrasonography was performed to know the lymph node involvement. It revealed a well defined nodular mass inseparable from the right submandibular salivary gland with central cavitation and papillary projections into the cavity suggesting a neoplastic process involving the right submandibular gland ().
Aspiration of the submandibular mass was done which revealed a clear straw colored fluid (). Cytological smear showed squamous cells with mild pleomorphism and large number of inflammatory cells spread over a background of eosinophilic acellular material. Histopathological report revealed islands of tumor epithelial cells with abundant keratin formation scattered over a densely fibrous stroma with dense chronic inflammatory infiltrate suggesting a well- differentiated squamous cell carcinoma ().
Patient was subjected to wide surgical excision of the lesion (hemimandibulectomy). Radical neck dissection was performed using Macaffe incision sacrificing internal jugular vein, sternocleidomastoid muscle, spinal accessory nerve, omohyoid muscle, facial artery and vein, occipital artery and submandibular gland and its duct. Reconstruction was done with pectoralis major myocutaneous flap. Follow up of the patient showed satisfactory healing of the wound with mild disfigurement of the face due to scar contracture ().","

CR_ENG_51,English,"A 33-year-old pregnant woman (3 gestations, 1 delivery, and 1 abortion) had antenatal diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus, which was treated by dietary control. A preplanned ultrasound assessment detected the presence of congenital left diaphragmatic hernia of poor prognosis (initial lung area to head circumference ratio = 0.85) and normal fetal karyotype. A fetoscopic endotracheal occlusion was successfully performed at 28 weeks 1/7 days gestation with subsequent improvement of lung area to head circumference ratio to 1.07. During a follow-up ultrasound examination performed at 32 gestational weeks, the mother complained of lower belly pain and contractions. On physical examination, she presented 4 uterine contractions in 30 minutes and had cervicodilatation of 2 cm. She was then hospitalized to remove the fetal endotracheal balloon by ultrasound-guided puncture to prevent fetal asphyxia after delivery and placental detachment. Before the procedure, the fetus was routinely anesthetized with an intramuscular injection on the left thigh (targeting the quadriceps muscle) containing pancuronium (0.50 mg/0.25 mL) and fentanyl (40.0 μg/0.8 mL), using a 20 G × 6 in. needle. After written informed consent was provided by the mother, and for the purposes of assessing putative pain-related behaviours noninvasively during the procedure, we have added a second ultrasound machine in the operating room (Voluson E8; GE Health-care, Zipf, Austria) operated by a second foetal medicine specialist exclusively to monitor the facial expressions of the foetus during the anaesthetic puncture. We have recorded the preanaesthetic and postanaesthetic 4D ultrasound films and presented it to 3 coders to assess facial expressions using the NFCS, which is validated to detect pain behaviours and suffering healthy and preterm newborns, but never before used during the intrauterine life during acute pain conditions (Fig. and Supplemental Digital Content, ). The 10 facial actions of the NFCS were coded: brow lowering, eyes squeezed shut, deepening of the nasolabial furrow, open lips, vertical mouth stretch, horizontal mouth stretch, taut tongue (cupping of the tongue), chin quiver (high frequency vibration of the chin), lip purse (tightening the muscles around the lips to form “oo”), and tongue protrusion. Each face action was classified as visible or not, and, if visible, they were coded as 1/0 (occurred/did not occur). Four dimensional ultrasound images were recorded before and after the anaesthetic procedure and were anonymized for off-line assessment including: (1) a baseline period defined as the least 30 seconds before the anaesthesia puncture and (2) the 45 seconds immediately after the puncture (Supplemental Digital Content, ). Thus, video extracts were presented to 3 coders with no previous background in behavioural coding: a neurologist, a psychologist, and a fetal medicine obstetrician specialized in 4D ultrasound of foetuses. All coders were blinded to the timing of the videos (before vs after puncture), which were randomly presented to each coder (scores were illustrated in Tables ).","

CR_ENG_53,English,"A man aged 57 years presented with a 2-day history of melaena, right-sided chest pain, abdominal pain and shortness of breath. He had a background of antimitochondrial antibody-positive primary biliary cholangitis diagnosed 10 years previously. He reported an alcohol intake of 23 units (∼200 g) per week and was an ex-smoker. His only medication was urseodeoxycholic acid (15 mg/kg). He had previously declined a screening gastroscopy. Ultrasound scan 10 months prior to this admission showed a cirrhotic liver with hepatopetal flow of the portal vein.
At presentation, he was and remained cardiovascularly stable. Examination of his abdomen elicited mild tenderness in the epigastrium, with no evidence of guarding. Digital rectal examination confirmed the presence of melaena. Investigations were as follows: haemoglobin (Hb) 135 g/L (range 135–170 g/L), WCC 12×109/L, platelets 219×109/L, MCV 91 fL, clotting, U&Es and LFTs normal. His vital signs on admission were: blood pressure 153/104 mm Hg, heart rate 140 bpm, temperature 36.5°C and saturations >96%. He underwent an oesophagogastroduodenoscopy (OGD) 21 hours after admission, which confirmed the presence of a small amount of altered blood in the stomach and 4 grade 2 oesophageal varices without any stigmata of recent bleeding (fibrin plugs) but with red spots (A).
The duodenum was reported to be normal. Ligation bands were applied to the oesophageal varices (B). Treatment was started with terlipressin and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Although his haemoglobin began to slowly drop, he remained stable until 3 days after the first gastroscopy, when he experienced further melaena and a number of presyncopal episodes. His Hb dropped to 77 g/L, urea 8.6 mmol/L and all other blood results were normal. The Blatchford score was 17. Once stable, he underwent a second OGD under general anaesthesia (4 hours after the episode of melaena). There was no visible blood in the upper GI tract. Banding-induced ulceration was present in the oesophagus and the brisk self-limiting bleeding was presumed to be due to oesophageal ulceration. The endoscopist reported a possible 2 cm polyp/lipoma in the second part of the duodenum. Again, the melaena settled and he remained stable postendoscopy (Hb 70 g/L). Two days later, he had two further episodes of melaena and failed to augment his Hb, despite 2 units of blood. A third OGD was carried out under conscious sedation on day 7 of his admission. Again, the upper GI tract was blood-free and the findings were similar to the second OGD (A). The endoscopist thought the previously described duodenal polyp could be a prominent ampulla, which prompted the request for an abdominal CT scan (B) to exclude a potential cause for haemobilia.
The next day, his Hb continued to drop to 55g/L, and he reported ongoing melaena. His vital signs at this point were: blood pressure 125/66 mm Hg, heart rate 125 bpm, temperature 38.9°C and saturations >96%. The decision was made to resuscitate with blood and proceed to an urgent fourth OGD. On this examination, there was altered blood in the stomach but again no obvious actively bleeding point. It was noted that the tip of the duodenal lesion was red (). The endoscopist was pondering over this finding when the lesion briefly spurted blood ().
The possible diagnosis of haemobilia crossed the endoscopist's mind and a side viewing scope (duodenoscope) was used to attempt further therapy. The duodenal lesion was felt to be in the third part of the duodenum and indeed, on closer inspection, the ampulla was located in the second part of the duodenum and found to be normal ().
It is at this point that the diagnosis of duodenal variceal bleed was made. The varix was treated successfully with 2.4 mL histoacryl glue using a normal gastroscope. The patient subsequently remained stable and free of any further GI bleeding. He was discharged 48 hours later. His Hb remained stable at 92 g/L.","

CR_ENG_55,English,"A 75 year old gentleman presented to the gastroenterology clinic for evaluation of dysphagia. He had a history of stage I (pT1N0Mx), moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma of the distal esophagus treated with surgical resection and intrathoracic esophagogastric anastomosis 10 years earlier. He had a ten pack-year smoking history, but stopped smoking around the time of his surgery, and does not drink alcohol. Since his surgery he had experienced no major associated symptoms until 6 months prior to his current presentation, at which time he described a sensation of something in the back of his throat. This progressed to frank dysphagia for both solids and liquids. He pursued evaluation at an outside facility, where CT of the neck demonstrated a 5.0×2.0×2.8 cm obstructing abnormality in the proximal esophagus (). Upper endoscopy then revealed an impacted piece of steak which was removed, as well as a 2.0 cm polypoid lesion. A repeat endoscopy performed the next month redemonstrated the polyp as well as an area of fullness in the proximal esophagus. Biopsies were obtained at that time and were interpreted as sarcomatoid squamous cell carcinoma. After presentation to our facility the patient underwent upper endoscopy with endoscopic ultrasound (EUS), demonstrating a pedunculated mass in the cervical esophagus, originating at the cricopharyngeus (). The mass measured 5.0 cm in length and up to 1.0 cm in thickness. On sonographic evaluation local invasion appeared limited to the superficial mucosal layer. The lesion was resected completely in piecemeal fashion with biopsy then obtained from the resection bed.
Pathology examination revealed a high-grade spindle cell tumor in a whorled pattern. The tumor cells showed marked cytological atypia and brisk mitotic activity. Focal necrosis was also noted. Immunohistochemical studies showed that the spindle cells were negative for pancytokeratin, desmin, actin, p63, CD 34, CD 117, CAM 5.2 and CK 5/6. The proliferative rate was high by Ki-67 (80%). Fluorescent in situ hybridization study demonstrated amplification of the CPM gene in 80% of lesional cells. Although the entire specimen was comprised of high grade sarcoma and no well-differentiated liposarcoma was seen, the overall findings suggested the tumor likely represented a de-differentiated liposarcoma. The procedural bed biopsy was negative ().
PET scan one month later demonstrated decreasing avidity at the surgical site and no increased uptake suggestive of recurrence or metastasis. Repeat endoscopy/EUS demonstrated reflux esophagitis with focal Barrett’s mucosa on biopsy, but no evidence of residual tumor or recurrence. Given this it was decided to withhold radiation therapy at that time and pursue close observation. The patient is now 20 months out from his procedure and has had no evidence of local recurrence or metastasis on most recent CT imaging and endoscopy.","

CR_ENG_56,English,"A 15-year-old Malay girl was referred to our center with a right lunate bone dislocation after being treated as osteomyelitis of the right distal ulna and radius for six months. Initially, she presented with right wrist pain, which worsened after lifting heavy objects, with increasing pain intensity, especially at night. However, the swelling started at the wrist and gradually increased in size, especially in the last three months. She denied any history of recent trauma or falls. Her condition was associated with a significant loss of weight over the previous six weeks prior to admission. Physical examination showed diffuse, circumferential tender swelling at the right wrist joint. Wrist motion was markedly restricted (Figure ).
Radiograph of the right wrist showed a moth-eaten appearance of the distal radius at the metaphyseal region, lytic lesion, and cortex breakage at the radius styloid, a narrow zone of transition, increased soft tissue shadow, and thinning of the cortex (Figure ).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a soft tissue mass occupying the distal right radius and ulna, extending the carpal bones. This mass measures approximately 7.5 cm x 7.4 cm x 8.8 cm (Figure ), suggesting a high-grade malignant tumor grown widely into the soft tissue from intramedullary bone.

CR_ENG_57,English,"A 46-year-old male patient with well-controlled hypertension, but who is otherwise fit and healthy, presented to our emergency department with sudden-onset epigastric pain. The pain started after completing a weight exercise at the gym, radiated across the abdomen, and progressively worsened. Physical examination revealed a blood pressure of 140/84 mmHg, with otherwise normal vital signs. Abdominal examination revealed epigastric tenderness without any palpable masses, guarding, or peritonism. All laboratory tests were normal including full blood count, urea and electrolytes, C-reactive protein, lipase, liver function, and vasculitis screening. A bedside ultrasound in the emergency department showed irregularities of the superior mesenteric artery (SMA). Computed tomography angiography (CTA) showed an acute dissection of the celiac trunk commencing 15 mm from its origin (), extending into the origin of the common hepatic and splenic arteries, and a long segment dissection involving the SMA commencing at the origin to the level of L2, with a thrombosed false lumen (). Conservative management was initiated, with aggressive blood pressure control aiming for a systolic blood pressure of 100 to 120 mmHg. Further, heparin infusion was commenced in the intensive care unit where continuous blood pressure monitoring was carried out.
SAM was diagnosed on the basis of the patient’s history, clinical examination, CTA findings, and ruling out of other causes. Immunological laboratory tests were performed to exclude autoimmune or inflammatory causes of vasculopathy. Further investigations of hypertension, including renal tract ultrasound, urine catecholamine test, and renin-aldosterone ratio determination, yielded normal findings.
Serial CTA scans were performed to monitor the progression of arterial dissection owing to ongoing abdominal pain. On day 11 of admission, the patient experienced gradually worsening abdominal pain, one episode of diarrhea after a meal, and elevated lactate levels. Because of the suspicion of an ischemic event, CTA was performed, which showed new thrombosis of the false lumen within the SMA, with underfilling of the SMA distally (, ). The patient underwent angiography and endovascular stenting of the aneurysmal section of the SMA with a 6×40 mm Tigris® stent (Gore-Tex, Newark, DE, USA) distally and a 7×80 mm Tigris® stent extended proximally. A completion angiogram showed much improved filling of the SMA and distal branches. The patient underwent surveillance CTA at 6 weeks from presentation, which showed stable disease, patent SMA stent, and filling of the distal branches (–).","

CR_ENG_59,English,"A 13-year-old Sri Lankan boy presented to our medical unit with a sudden onset tonic-clonic convulsion of the right arm with secondary generalization resulting in loss of consciousness lasting about 10 minutes. He developed two similar focal fits after admission of which the durations were about 5 minutes each. When further questioning from the parents, it was revealed that he had developed sore throat and fever 2 weeks prior to admission and were resolved with treatment including an oral antibiotic. He was fever free for about one week but he complained of recurrent frontal headaches. He had not noticed any gross hematuria, dysuria or decreased urine output prior to admission. On the day of admission the patient had developed repeated episodes of vomiting and, increased sleepiness. He also noticed to have transient visual disturbances which he explained as distorted sizes of the images. The patient also gave a history of an infected wound over right ankle that he had 2 weeks back, which was healed by the time of admission.
On admission he was drowsy but rousable with a Glasgow coma scale (GCS) of 13/15. He had mild periorbital swelling, without clinically detectable dependant edema. His throat was not inflamed and his thyroid gland was normal. He didn’t have any signs of meningeal irritation or any focal neurological signs. His blood pressure was 130/80 mmHg on admission with a significant protein urea detected by dipstick. Within 2 hours his blood pressure raised up to 200/100 mmHg and he was admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) for close monitoring and further management. While in the ICU intravenous antihypertensive drugs were used to control the blood pressure. Later blood pressure was controlled with oral antihypertensive medications. His urinalysis reported as moderately field full red cells with dysmorphic red cells of 15% suggestive of hematuria of glomerular origin and occasional pus cells but no cellular casts. His anti streptolysin O titre (ASOT) reported as more than 200 U/mL and was considered significant, urine and the throat swab cultures were sterile. He had normal serum creatinine and electrolytes; however his blood urea was elevated up to 26.7 mmol/L despite adequate hydration. His serum protein was low. Diagnosis of acute PSGN was made and he was started on intra venous (IV) penicillin.
During the second day of ICU his urine output started declining to less than 0.5 mL/kg/h. His peri orbital swelling worsened and developed bilateral plural effusions and ascites. He was started on IV furosemide and strict fluid balance was maintained. His blood urea started to rise despite adequate hydration but other renal functions including serum creatinine remained normal. He underwent ultrasound scan of the abdomen on day-2 of the admission and showed ultrasonic evidence of acute renal parenchymal disease, ascites and bilateral plural effusions. Blood picture was suggestive of acute bacterial infection but the blood cultures and throat swab cultures were sterile. He underwent 24 hour urine collection and found to have sub-nephrotic range protein urea of 0.6 g/24 h. An urgent electro encephalogram (EEG) was done on admission and showed changes suggestive of encephalopathy secondary to recurrent fits, he was started on sodium valproate and phenytoin sodium by the neurologist.
A contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of brain done on day-3 and revealed non-enhancing low-attenuating areas in fronto -parietal regions (Figure ). There was no abnormal meningeal enhancement or focal lesions. A T2 weighted image of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was taken on day-10 of the admission and found to have linier sub-cortical hyper intensities in both parietal regions which was consistent with the radiological diagnosis of PRES. MRI findings were less intensive than CT finding suggesting recovery of the cerebral insults during that period (Figure ). As cerebral vascuitis was also a possibility, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), anti nuclear antibody (ANA) and anti neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) were done and found to be negative. After 5 days of ICU stay followed by 2 days of inward stay, patient's blood pressure was well controlled with oral captopril. He had a satisfactory urine output without diuretics and no clinical or biochemical evidence of acute kidney injury. His hematuria was settling and he was seizure free. His vision had returned to normal. He was discharged with the antihypertensive and anti-epileptics and planned to be reviewed weekly in the outpatient clinic. After 3 weeks, his hematuria had totally resolved according to repeat urinalysis and antihypertensive drug was gradually tailed off whilst patient was normotensive. He underwent a repeat MRI scan 3 weeks later and the above radiological manifestations disappeared, thus it was reported as normal.","

CR_ENG_60,English,"In October 2020, a 69-year-old Caucasian female developed acute, binocular, horizontal diplopia eight days after testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 infection. A non-smoker with no known generalised hypertension or diabetes, her only medications were Bimatoprost, (Lumigan) taken one drop into both eyes daily for ocular hypertension, and Sertraline. She reported no history of childhood strabismus. Interestingly, the patient reported a similar episode of diplopia subsequent to flu eight years ago. This resolved spontaneously. No medical records were available of this previous episode as no ophthalmological assessment was carried out at the time.
The patient reported no headache, fever or respiratory symptoms. Anosmia was her sole symptom of COVID-19 infection. The patient was reviewed by the Orthoptist. Ocular motility examination revealed a -1 under action of the left lateral rectus on laevoversion. Alternate prism cover test for distance fixation at 6 m measured a left esotropia of 10Δ in primary position, 7Δ left esotropia on dextroversion and 18Δ left esotropia on laevoversion. The patient reported diplopia in primary position, dextroversion and laevoversion at 6 m. Alternate cover test at 1/3 m revealed a slight esophoria with delayed recovery, this measured 10Δ esophoria. These findings are consistent with left abducens nerve palsy. Her best corrected visual acuity was normal; it measured –0.100 (6/4.8) in the right eye and 0.020 (6/6-1) in the left eye on the ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) chart at 4 m (). Pupils were equal and reactive to light. There was no afferent pupillary defect. An eight-dioptre base out Fresnel prism was fitted to the patient’s glasses to relieve diplopia. The patient was also reviewed by an Ophthalmologist in the Emergency Eye Centre. No further investigations were ordered.
The patient was assessed by the Orthoptist 5 weeks later. Left abducens nerve palsy had completely resolved. She reported no diplopia in any gaze position. The patient reported complete resolution of diplopia within 3.5 weeks of onset. Ocular motility was full. Alternate prism cover test for distance fixation at 6 m measured no deviation in primary position, 3Δ esophoria on dextroversion and 2Δ esophoria on laevoversion. Alternate cover test revealed a slight exophoria at 1/3 m with good recovery, this measured 4Δ exophoria. BSV responses for near and distance were recorded using the ‘Worth 4 dot test’. This case has demonstrated the value of the Orthoptist in relieving symptomatic diplopia and advising on prognosis for recovery in post-viral neuropathies.
Two additional cases of transient abducens nerve palsy in two young otherwise healthy patients were noted in May 2020. Both patients reported clinically suspicious symptoms of COVID-19 in the weeks preceding the development of the nerve palsy. Unfortunately, neither individual met government testing criteria at the time of onset so real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests were not performed, therefore COVID-19 diagnosis was unconfirmed. Similarly, antibody testing was unavailable for the general public at this time. Moreover, anosmia was not listed as an official symptom of COVID-19 by the UK government until 19th May 2020 (). Since May 2020, understanding of COVID-19 presentation has developed; consequently, more symptoms are formally recognised. Patient A was a healthy 47-year-old Caucasian female schoolteacher who presented with isolated left abducens palsy. She reported symptoms of sore throat, fatigue, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness and nausea seven weeks prior to the diplopia onset. Diplopia fully resolved in primary position within one month. Residual esophoria was present on laevoversion and dextroversion. Patient B was a healthy 38-year-old male of Chinese ethnicity who presented with isolated right abducens palsy. He worked as a caregiver in a residential home setting with recent confirmed COVID-19 outbreak. He reported symptoms of dry cough, sore throat and malaise two to four weeks prior to onset of diplopia. Diplopia in primary position resolved within one month. Ocular motility was full. In both cases, ophthalmological assessment was unremarkable and MRI scans normal. In the absence of a space occupying lesion and demyelination, post-viral aetiology was suggested. Both patients worked in high-risk occupations, hence COVID-19 exposure is highly possible. Notwithstanding, this evidence is speculative in the absence of a confirmed positive COVID-19 test.","

CR_ENG_61,English,"A 72-year-old Caucasian lady presented to the Maxillofacial outpatient clinic via her general practitioner with a 12-month history of tenderness around the left side of the oropharynx. She reported painful swallowing mostly with solid foods and felt it was getting worse. She also reported that she was unable to lie flat due to severe pain. Based on these symptoms, the patient had been diagnosed with gastroesophageal reflux and had been placed on regular proton pump inhibitor (esomeprazole) by her general practitioner. This medication failed to control or improve her symptoms. It was also noted from her medical history that she had previously suffered with a tonsillar carcinoma on the left side and had been treated with surgery and radiotherapy years earlier.
Physical examination revealed an edentulous patient with an irregular red lesion in the left side of the soft palate with a bony hard, slender mass protruding into the mouth covered by mucosa (Fig. ). There was no evidence of ulceration, induration or any other lesions present in the mouth. Extraoral examination was completely normal with no clinical evidence of cervical lymphadenopathy. An orthopantomogram demonstrated an elongated styloid process.
The patient was clinically diagnosed with an elongated, medially deflected and symptomatic styloid process. The proposed management plan was for surgical reduction of the protruding process via an intraoral approach.
Under a general anaesthetic, a mucosal incision over the protruding process was made with monopolar diathermy. Periosteal elevators were used to free all the soft tissue attachments off the styloid process (Fig. ). Once cleared, 2.5 cm of the styloid was removed with a Rongeurs bone nibbling forceps. This was judged clinically to be a sufficient length to clear the oral cavity of any interference from the protruding styloid process. Bleeding was controlled with bipolar-diathermy forceps and the mucosal incision closed with 3.0 vicryl interrupted sutures.
The patient stayed overnight and was discharged home on the following day. Post operatively she was reviewed after one week and after 6 months following surgery. She reported complete relief of her symptoms and had normal swallowing was back on a normal diet. She was subsequently discharged.","

The patient also reported weight loss of 35 pounds within the last 3 months. The patient reported recent travel to Vermont. She denied any symptoms of sore throat, abdominal discomfort, nausea, vomiting or dysuria. She denied any fevers at home, however, she was febrile upon presentation. She denied any history of skin psoriasis or IBD, inflammatory low back pain, dactylitis, enthesitis or uveitis. She also denied any history of photosensitive skin rash, malar rash or oral or nasal ulcers. There was no recent use of any antibiotics, any hospitalizations or i.v. drug use.
On physical examination, the patient had a temperature of 99.1°F, pulse 104 bpm, blood pressure 104/57 mmHg, respiratory rate 18 and oxygen saturation 96–97% on room air. A musculoskeletal exam was positive for findings of tenderness over her anterior leg over the shin and tenderness on palpation across multiple joints. No obvious clubbing in her fingers was noted. She had swelling with mild synovitis across her wrists, MCP joints, PIP joints, knees, ankle and MTP and IP joints. The patient’s blood work showed elevated acute phase reactions, namely ESR at 39 mm/h and CRP at 11.2 mg/L.

CR_ENG_63,English,"A 24-year-old Hispanic female with diabetes mellitus type 1, anemia, hypertension, chronic pancreatitis with partial pancreatectomy, cholecystectomy, and splenectomy presented to the emergency department (ED) with abdominal pain not relieved by oral pain medications. She recalled her home medications to be mirtazapine 30 mg orally nightly, fluoxetine unknown dose orally three times a day, carbamazepine 200 mg orally twice daily, insulin glargine 15–20 units subcutaneously nightly, morphine sulfate 30 mg orally twice daily, tramadol 50 mg orally four times a day, hydromorphone 4 mg orally six times a day as needed for pain, and hydrocodone/acetaminophen 325/10 mg orally six times a day as needed for pain, and she had been taking them to relieve her pain. She was discharged from the ED but returned on the same day with worsening abdominal pain, loss of sensation in lower extremities, lips, and hands, and ascending paralysis. The patient was noted to have a leukocytosis with bandemia, fever, and tachycardia suspicious for sepsis. Computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen was significant for small bowel edema and ascites. The patient continued to deteriorate with worsening ascending paralysis, bilateral hearing loss, hypotension, and respiratory failure with subsequent endotracheal intubation. She underwent two rounds of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for a total of approximately 109 minutes but ultimately expired.
An autopsy was performed and documented a well-developed woman with no evidence of traumatic injuries. Postmortem serum analysis revealed fatal levels of heart blood fluoxetine concentration of 2.3 mcg/mL.
The cause of death was thought to be multiple medication intoxication with fatal levels of fluoxetine. A neuropathologist was consulted who agreed with the diagnosis and thought that her symptoms were primarily due to overmedication with fluoxetine. She had no known history of suicidal ideation or attempt but did have chronic pain. Thus, the favored mode of death was accident. Contributory factors to death included acute on chronic, culture negative pancreatitis with abscess formation, and likely sepsis.","

CR_ENG_64,English,"A 22-year-old male who is not a known case of any medical illness, presented to the clinic following a local hospital referral, with a 2-year history of right shoulder pain. The pain started gradually and increased in severity over time. It was worse at night awakening the patient from sleep. There was no history of trauma or shoulder injury. The patient was referred to physiotherapy with the impression of impingement syndrome based on X Ray and clinical examination findings, yet there was no improvement (). He was then advised for arthroscopic sub acromial decompression following failure of the conservative management.
The pain did not improve after the arthroscopic sub acromial decompression surgery. Following this, the patient started to experience increased pain at rest. Further imaging was ordered including an MRI of the cervical spine and brachial plexus along with a nerve conduction study, all of which were reported to be normal. The patient received a total of 3 intra-articular corticosteroid injections which still did not relieve the pain.
A non-contrast MRI of the affected shoulder was performed which showed a suspicious lesion at the base of the coracoid. Common coracoid process tumors such as chondrosarcomas, osteoblastomas, and chondroblastomas` [] were ruled out as subsequent contrast-enhanced MRI and CT scans of the scapula confirmed the presence of a benign “OO” (, , ).
After the radiological diagnosis of “OO” of the coracoid process was made by the referring local hospital, the patient was booked for a 2nd arthroscopic shoulder surgery which was performed by a senior consultant of orthopedic surgery. The patient was placed in a beach chair position and image intensifier-guided drilling of the osteoid osteoma lesion was done under general anesthesia. The surgery involved identifying the lesion using a C-arm X-Ray machine followed by the insertion of a guide wire through the lesion and ultimately drilling it with 4.5 mm and 6 mm drills respectively. Arthroscopic shaving and debridement of the lesion followed. The patient was discharged home on the same day in a stable condition with a cuff and collar brace and oral analgesics.
Following surgery, at the 1-week follow up in clinic, the patient reported complete resolution of pain and expressed satisfaction towards the treatment received. The subsequent follow-ups confirmed complete resolution of symptoms and the patient was then advised to mobilize the arm and engage in normal daily activities.","

CR_ENG_65,English,"A 36-year-old man presented with hemifacial atrophy (depressed forehead and glabella area). The disease progressed from 5 to 16 years old. The patient had alopecia on frontal scalp and received a surgery using tissue expander. The alopecia lesion was covered by expanded scalp flap done 22 years ago. Also, he was treated with fat grafts on depressed forehead 17 years ago. However, it did not work sufficiently, and there was noted depressed forehead (, ). We planned to make 3D titanium implant to cover the depressed area (from the superior orbital rim to the vertex) ().
The titanium implant was manufactured and fabricated by Medyssey (Dongducheon, Korea) using 3D computed tomography data and an electron beam melting machine. We used Mimics software for 3D printing. The final implant design incorporated 2-mm thickness for bone-like rigidity. After manufacturing the 3D implant, we simulated the operation with it to the patient’s rapid prototyping model. Under general endotracheal anesthesia, we made bicoronal incision using previous scar, and exposed the whole depressed area, and fixed the 3D titanium implant with 4-mm titanium screws. During the operation, we confirmed that the custom-made 3D implant accurately fit for the depressed area without any dead spaces (). A negative drain was inserted under the scalp, and total operation time was 2 hours 30 minutes. The operative site healed without any complication. Previously depressed forehead and glabella lesions were elevated, and the forehead contour was improved cosmetically. No complications were reported. The patient was seen 1 month after the intervention. He was satisfied with the result obtained. The patient returned to our clinic 6 months after the intervention in order to evaluate the result.

CR_ENG_67,English,"A 50-year-old male, underwent double lung transplant for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Two weeks following his transplant, he was readmitted with acute onset of severe shortness of breath. His Computed tomography (CT) of the chest revealed a small air collection adjacent to right anastomotic site with bilateral pleural effusions. His echocardiogram demonstrated large circumferential pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology. The pericardial fluid was evacuated by a pericardial window and a right sided chest tube.
Flexible bronchoscopy (FB) was performed the same day, which confirmed bilateral bronchial dehiscence, worse on the right, with a 1.5 cm defect of antero-lateral wall of right main stem bronchus with separation of suture line from donor bronchus []. There was a free moving flap and full thickness necrosis of the wall which extended down to bronchus intermedius. A 14 mm × 40 mm uncovered Ultraflex® SEMS was deployed over a guidewire in the right main bronchus to bridge the dehiscence. With bronchoscopic forceps, the stent was gently repositioned firmly against the secondary carina in an effort to cover the defect. A 12 mm controlled radial expansion (CRE) balloon was used to dilate the stent across the area of the anastomosis. The balloon of smaller diameter was used to avoid undue high atmospheric pressures at the site of disruption. At the end of the procedure, the stent was in a visibly good position.
Patient was doing well at home for 3 weeks when he experienced a sudden massive hemoptysis. In emergency, his airway was noted to be filled with blood and he had right sided hydropneumothorax.

CR_ENG_71,English,"A 71 year-old male presented with a pharyngocutaneous fistula on the background of a stage 4 (T4aN2M0) right piriform fossa Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) managed with laryngectomy, partial pharyngectomy, bilateral neck dissections, and reconstruction of a neopharynx using an ALT flap. The patient received 56Gy post-operative radiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy.
The patient presented a chronic non-healing wound (a common and difficult problem in irradiated tissue) and progressive reduction in oral intake. Having undergone serial balloon dilatation for management of his neo-pharyngo-esophageal stricture and concurrently developing a pharyngocutaneous fistula 3 years post operatively, the patient underwent intraoperative stricture release and excision of fistula, leaving a 4 cm circumferential defect.
Given the hostile nature of his irradiated, previously dissected and fibrotic neck tissue, an IMAP flap was preferred rather than free tissue transfer for reconstruction. Intraoperative exploration demonstrated a suitable IMA/V perforator in the left 2nd intercostal space, which was utilized to raise an IMAP flap (). The flap was extended to the midaxillary line, raised in a suprafascial plane, with paddle dimensions of superior width 6 cm, inferior width 5 cm, and a length of 4 cm and tubed on the chest. After de-epithelialization and islanding, the flap was tunneled across a short skin bridge, inset into the defect over a nasogastric tube and the external defect was closed ().
The patient demonstrated a successful gastrografin swallow test at 6-weeks with no significant leak and wound fully healed. Six- months post-operatively, he continues to maintain adequate dietary intake independent of his percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube, a significant improvement noted by both the patient and ongoing speech pathology assessments ().","

CR_ENG_73,English,"A 21-year-old female G1P0 had a termination of her first pregnancy by suction evacuation of a complete hydatidiform mole one year ago. During her preoperative and postsuction follow-up, she had persistently elevated serum level (14,476 IU/L) of beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG). She was labeled as GTN-stage I and received methotrexate (MTX) chemotherapy according to WHO score of low risk. Eventual normalization of serum b-HCG was achieved after eight cycles of chemotherapy; she was followed up every 4–6 weeks with pelvic ultrasound scan and serum b-HCG level.
She presented with a 4-week history of headache and progressive left periorbital fullness with blurred vision. Her vitals and general physical and genital examination were within normal; there was no abdominal swelling or vaginal bleeding.
An ophthalmological examination showed the fullness over the left upper lid and mild ptosis (). The vision in the affected left eye was 20/200 OS and the vision in the right was normal at 20/20 OD. A fundoscopic examination revealed multiple ill-defined subretinal lesions involving the choroid with the irregular surface. Exudative retinal detachment with shifting subretinal fluid was noted in the inferior fundus. An ultrasound B-scan evaluation (with vector A scan) of the left eye showed multiple choroid lesions with an irregular surface and moderate to high internal reflectivity suggesting choroid mass lesions of vascular nature. There was no evidence for choroidal excavation ().
Routine laboratory blood investigations were within normal; however, b-HCG was grossly elevated (20,165 IU/L). Metastatic work-up included computed tomographic (CT) studies of the brain, chest, abdomen, and pelvis, which showed multiple hemorrhagic brain lesions, multiple lung nodules, and a small suspected metastatic lesion in the left adrenal gland. There were endometrial infiltrating uterine mass and cystic right adnexal lesion identified as a locoregional recurrence. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the brain revealed multiple small hemorrhagic metastases demonstrated on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) ().
Orbital MRI scan demonstrated a marginally exophytic lesion in the left eye at the level of choroid adjacent to the optic disc appearing hyperintense to gray matter on T1-weighted images (). There was no calcification seen in the slice-matched CT images, thus helping in distinguishing between possible synchronous choroidal pathologies like retinoblastoma. The lesion was hypointense on T2-FLAIR images (). The high-resolution axial 3D- constructive interference in steady state (CISS) images showed the full extent of the lesion, which was confined to the retinal choroid with normal appearances of the vitreous chamber of the globe (). On imaging, after intravenous gadolinium, the lesion demonstrated homogenous enhancement in keeping with a vascular tumor. Another focal lesion was seen centered in the left lacrimal gland distorting the lacrimal contour (). The dark periosteum of the superior orbital ridge was lost in the MRI study, which showed an amorphous enhancement, and a comparison with the CT study revealed faint periosteum thickening (). Both findings were in keeping with bone infiltration.
Given the significant disease burden, history of GC, and uterine and systemic imaging findings, the patient was diagnosed as recurrent GC. Based on the modified WHO prognostic scoring system adopted by FIGO for GTN [], the patient was diagnosed as a high-risk GTN with a score of >7. A multidisciplinary team was involved in management planning for this patient including gynecological oncology, radiology, ophthalmology, and radiation oncology.
The patient was started on EMA-CO chemotherapy regimen (etoposide, methotrexate, folinic acid, actinomycin D, cyclophosphamide, and vincristine). Additionally, the patient was also started on high-dose dexamethasone to reduce cerebral edema exerted by the brain metastasis and received whole brain radiation. She tolerated the treatment well with eventual normalization of her b-HCG, and metastatic imaging scans surveillance was negative for 2-year follow-up.","

Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy revealed severe reduction of all cell lineages without evidence of neoplastic infiltration, dysplasia, or fibrosis. The counted cellularity was 5% in bone marrow. Bone marrow karyotype analysis was normal. A gastroenterology consultation performed for the liver enzyme abnormalities did not provide an etiologic factor, pointing toward drug-induced hepatitis. Further work-ups, including levels of vitamin B12 and folate; neck, chest, and abdominopelvic computerized tomography; serology and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for viral hepatitis, human immunodeficiency, Epstein-Barr virus, parvovirus B19, and cytomegalovirus; FLAER test for paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria; antinuclear antibody test; HLA-DRB1*15; and quantiferon test for tuberculosis, were all negative. The patient was diagnosed with AA, which was not severe at that time. Terbinafine treatment was stopped. Due to the use of a drug with probable hematologic toxicity, follow-up with supportive care was planned for the patient. During 3-4 weeks of follow-up time, blood values worsened with the need for erythrocyte and thrombocyte transfusions, in accordance with very severe AA (SAA). She did not have a matched related donor for transplantation. After confirming the diagnosis with a second bone marrow biopsy, she received rabbit antithymocyte globulin (ATG) plus cyclosporine-A (CYC). The clinical outcome after ATG + CYC was poor due to transient worsening of hematopoiesis and infectious complications. She spent 3 months in the hospital with perianal abscess, invasive aspergillosis, zoster virus reactivation, and several catheter infections. She required physical and psychological rehabilitation. Fortunately, the blood values began to recover at the end of the fourth month and full hematologic recovery was achieved at the end of the sixth month. The patient is still in complete remission after 18 months of ATG + CYC treatment ( and ).","

CR_ENG_79,English,"A 34-year-old female who has no previous clinical illness presented in 2000 with a large irregular mass, estimated clinically to be around 5 × 6 cm by physical examination, involving the right breast while she was lactating. There were no other signs or symptoms. FNA was done to rule out breast cancer, and the specimen showed few foamy macrophages and rare clusters of ductal cells, with focal secretory lactational changes. Based on that, it was determined that the specimen was negative for malignancy. The tumor continued to grow, and in June 2004, FNA of the right breast was repeated and showed large staghorn-shaped sheets of uniform ductal cells with no cytologic atypia along with myoepithelial cells. There were fragments of fibrotic stroma and bare nuclei scattered in a bloody background, and so, a diagnosis of fibroadenoma was made. Two months later, the patient underwent excision of the tumor in another healthcare facility. Examination of the slides showed an overgrowth of epithelial and stromal components in pericanalicular and intracanalicular patterns with irregular large cystic spaces showing protruding leaf-like structures (). The stromal cells showed plump elongated slightly dysmorphic nuclei with occasional prominent nucleoli. Other areas showed significant cellular growth of the stromal spindle cells which appeared to be arranged in long intersecting fascicles and growing in herringbone pattern (). Within the spindle cell growth, extracellular mucin was noted. One focus showed an exclusive spindle cell growth which was moderately atypical with plump elongated hyperchromatic nuclei. Numerous mitosis was found, up to 20 in 10 high power fields in this focus. Entrapped epithelial ductal elements were occasionally seen in other areas exhibiting ductal epithelial hyperplasia. These features were consistent with malignant phyllodes tumor with stromal fibrosarcomatous overgrowth. The patient subsequently underwent mastectomy as the margins were focally involved. During the procedure, a mass measuring around 3-4 cm was found in the most posterior aspect of the breast and there was some indication that it may have invaded the pectoralis major muscle. All the breast tissue, the tumor, and some of the muscle fibers were removed. On gross examination, there were multiple tumor masses in the inner lower and outer upper quadrants, the largest being 3 cm. On microscopy, there was proliferation of atypical spindle and elongated plump cells with pleomorphic nuclei and occasional prominent nucleoli. Extracellular mucin was also identified. The atypical stromal cells formed herringbone fascicular growth pattern reminiscent to fibrosarcoma and numerous mitosis averaging around 14 mitosis in 10 high power fields. No residual phyllodes tumor elements were identified. The tumor nodules had a well-demarcated margin with focal infiltration of surrounding breast and adipose tissue. No lymphovascular invasion, necrosis, or heterologous differentiation was seen. All surgical margins and muscle fibers were not involved by the tumor. The skin and nipple did not show any involvement either. All these histological features were identical to those identified in her previous lumpectomy except that there was more pronounced atypia and no residual epithelial component of phyllodes tumor identified. No lymph nodes were identified. A year later, the patient began to suffer from acute bouts of pancreatitis and was admitted several times for this. In March of 2006, abdominal CT was performed and showed a heterogenous low attenuation soft tissue mass involving the head and body of the pancreas and was extending upwards. The celiac vessels and its branches were going through this mass but did not show any significant narrowing. There was obvious atrophy of the pancreatic tail and dilatation of the pancreatic duct. The mass was in contact with the anterior aspect of the inferior vena cava (IVC) with no clear fat plane in between (). Biopsy of the pancreatic mass showed uniform proliferation of elongated spindly cells which had coarse chromatin and mild to moderate nuclear pleomorphism. Some cells had plump hyperchromatic nuclei. Numerous mitotic figures were identified (). The background showed variable amounts of collagen and stroma with focal areas of myxoid appearance. Immunohistochemical staining showed strong positivity for vimentin; however, the cells were negative for actin, S100, and cytokeratin (). These findings were consistent with metastatic fibrosarcoma of the pancreas secondary to her primary breast lesion. Due to the location, extent, and nature of the condition, the case was deemed unresectable. Chemotherapy was initiated; and in the little chance that the tumor shrunk enough, the possibility of resecting the metastasis would be entertained. In January 2007, the patient presented to the ER with severe epigastric pain, where she collapsed, was hypotensive, and subsequently admitted. On examination, a tender mass in the epigastric area was felt. Urgent CT of the abdomen and pelvis with and without contrast showed a pseudoaneurysm in the splenic artery measuring around 3.5 cm. There was also expansion of the retroperitoneal mass and blood in the intraperitoneal cavity. There was heterogenous enhancement in the liver most probably indicating liver infarct. In addition, there were areas of the IVC which had markedly thinned wall and areas suspicious for active bleeding, especially from the proximal splenic artery (). The pancreatic fibrosarcoma had grown and eroded branches of the celiac artery with bleeding pseudoaneurysm along with infarct of the liver, spleen, and adjacent organs. The patient continued to be hypotensive with abdominal distention due to severe intra-abdominal bleeding and developed multiorgan failure and hemorrhagic shock leading to her death.","

### Summary"
CR_ENG_80,English,"A 72-year-old white woman was admitted to our hospital because of newly diagnosed hypercalcemia (albumin-corrected calcium 4.2 mmol/L; normal range 2.19–2.59 mmol/L) (Fig. ) and multiple bone lesions visualized by bone scintigraphy. For 6 months, she had experienced progressive weakness, bone pain, nausea, and body weight loss of 4 kg. In addition, she noticed nocturia and polydipsia. According to her husband, she had recently become depressive and forgetful. Seven years before, she had been treated for breast cancer. The tumor stage was pT1c, pN0, M0, G2, R0; her estrogen and progesterone receptor status was positive; and she was herceptin 2 receptor-negative. At that time, a segment resection and a sentinel lymph node biopsy, as well as radio- and chemotherapy, were carried out. No local tumor recurrence had been detected in the last ultrasonographic follow-up of the breast and lymph nodes a few months earlier. Having found hypercalcemia and an elevated alkaline phosphatase (AP) level (233 U/L; normal range 35–104 U/L), her practitioner directly initiated whole-body bone technetium-99m-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid (99mTc-DPD) scintigraphy (Fig. ), which showed multiple active hits, with the biggest lesions located in the os ilium and acetabulum on the right-hand side; unspecific, diffuse uptake in the calvarium; and multiple sites of focal uptake at costochondral junctions. In the context of the patient’s history of breast cancer, she was suspected of having multiple bone metastases.
On examination, the patient appeared to be in an afebrile, hemodynamically stable state, and no neurologic deficits were noticed. Her body mass index was 20.5 kg/m2. Laboratory studies showed hypercalcemia (albumin-corrected calcium 3.55 mmol/L), low phosphate (0.56 mmol/L; normal range 0.87–1.45 mmol/L), impaired renal function (creatinine 119 μmol/L, estimated glomerular filtration rate of 39 ml/minute), elevated AP (189 U/L), and a grossly elevated PTH level (1466 ng/L; normal range 15–65 ng/L) (Fig. , ). 25-OH-vitamin D was slightly decreased (14.2 μg/L, normal >20 μg/L). Tumor marker CA15-3 was normal (26.7 kU/L, normal <30 kU/L).
On the basis of the laboratory constellation of primary HPT, neck surgery was considered and proposed to the patient. We felt that this patient could benefit from parathyroid surgery and correction of hypercalcemia, regardless of a potential concomitant malignancy. Sonography and scintigraphy of the parathyroid glands were performed, and a parathyroid adenoma (>2 cm in diameter) was detected at the left inferior side. Concerning the possible metastatic bone disease, 18F-FDG-PET/computed tomography (CT) was carried out (Fig. ). This examination provided evidence of multiple metabolically active, predominantly lytic bone lesions in the pelvis and at the sternum as well as a corticalis-disrupting lesion in the glenoid on the left-hand side (Fig. , ).
The patient received intravenous continuous hydration (isotonic saline) and oral vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol 2000 U/day), and she consented to the proposed parathyroid surgery, which was carried out 1 week later. Following removal of the enlarged parathyroid gland (suspected to be the single source of excessive PTH; weighing 4.5 g), the patient’s intraoperative PTH level decreased to 22.6 ng/L (Fig. ), indicating removal of the culprit lesion. As expected, the lesion was posterior to the left lower thyroid pole and completely removed. In the postoperative course, no local (neck) complications were noticed.
After surgery, there was a progressive fall in serum calcium (total calcium down to a nadir of 1.96 mmol/L on day 5; albumin-corrected as shown in Fig. ), whereas phosphate remained low (0.52 mmol/L on the fifth postoperative day, returning to within the normal range 7 weeks later), and AP activity further increased up to 395 U/L 2 weeks after PTX (Fig. ). This increase could be attributed to an increase in the bone isoenzyme because bone-specific AP mass (up to 121 μg/L, normal postmenopausal range 6–26 μg/L) peaked at around the same time and came back to within the normal range by week 12 after PTX. PTH increased during the initial postoperative course (with low postoperative calcium) to 300 ng/L, ruling out hypoparathyroidism, and fasting urinary spot calcium excretion decreased to a level below the detection limit (Fig. ) and remained low (urinary calcium/creatinine molar ratio <0.1) until 10 weeks after surgery. This constellation suggested hungry bone syndrome (HBS), a common consequence following successful parathyroid surgery in patients with OFC, and we considered this postoperative course compatible with the bone lesions []. We started therapy with oral calcium (2 g/day) and calcitriol (0.5 μg/day), we continued treating the patient with vitamin D3 (2000 U/day, long-term). Owing to initial diagnostic uncertainty, signals sent by some physicians to the patient, and her fear of recurring malignancy, the largest lesion in the area of the pelvis was biopsied with CT guidance in an outpatient setting (3 weeks after PTX) (Fig. ). No malignant cells could be found, but the material turned out to be insufficient for pathological diagnosis by histological and immunohistochemical investigations. With the aim of gaining more information in the setting of an elevated AP (reflecting elevated bone turnover), we performed 18F-fluoride-PET (Fig. , , ) 7 weeks after PTX. In this investigation, all the lesions showed increased fluoride uptake and progressive sclerosis of some lesions reflecting bone mineralization. Additional open biopsies were performed 9 weeks after PTX (Fig. ). Tissue samples of the right patella and of the right os ilium (the most reachable lesions) were obtained; again, no malignant cells were found.
We regularly saw the patient in our consultation, and laboratory controls showed that the serum calcium could be kept in the normal range over weeks (Fig. ). The therapy with calcium and calcitriol was adapted continuously. Six months after PTX, the patient presented with a joint effusion of the left knee. The rheumatologists conducted a joint puncture, and aspiration material showed calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Twenty-three weeks after PTX and bone lesions of unknown etiology and significance, we conducted further follow-up imaging by 18F-FDG-PET/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Fig. , i, j) to prove BTs and again rule out malignancy. The bone lesions were no longer detectable in the PET component of the examination. One year after PTX, the patient no longer had joint pain, remained normocalcemic, was physically active, and found herself, in retrospect, much stronger than in many years before.","

CR_ENG_81,English,"The first case was a 50-year-old man with a history of cough and hemoptysis for 6 months and dyspnea for two months was referred to our hospital. Chest computed tomography (CT) and bronchoscopy showed a mass in the left main bronchus with atelectasis of the left lung. The mass extended up to the bifurcation of the upper and lower lobe orifices, and involved the carina and proximal portion of the right main bronchus (Fig. a and b). Histological examination of a biopsy specimen confirmed the diagnosis of pulmonary carcinoma. Preoperative lung-function tests demonstrated that the forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) was 1.93 L, the ratio of FEV1 to forced vital capacity (FEV1/FVC) was 59 %, and the maximum ventilatory volume (MVV) was 63 L/min. No distant metastases were found on fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT scans.
The other case was a 59-year-old man with a history of dry cough for more than four months was admitted to our department. Chest CT showed a mass that was located in the lower lobe of the left lung and involved the left main bronchus and carina. Bronchoscopy revealed a neoplasm occluding the left lower lobe bronchus and involving the left main bronchus, carina, and proximal portion of the right main bronchus. Histological examination revealed a squamous cell carcinoma. Pulmonary function tests demonstrated that FEV1, FEV1/FVC, and MVV were 3.4 L, 67 %, and 83 L/min, respectively. No distant metastases were observed.
Under combined general intravenous and inhalation anesthesia, independent lung ventilation was achieved through a double-lumen tube, and during airway reconstruction, patients were intermittently ventilated through cross-field right bronchial intubation.
Both patients underwent single-stage, bilateral thoracic surgery via a combined approach incorporating thoracotomy and VATS. After left lateral decubitus positioning, surgery was performed through right posterolateral thoracotomy in the fifth intercostal space including carinal resection, airway reconstruction, and systemic lymph node dissection. The trachea was resected approximately 1 cm above the carina, and the right main bronchus was transected at its distal portion. Both surgical margins were found to be cancer free on intraoperative frozen-section biopsy. The trachea and right main bronchus were anastomosed in an end-to-end fashion (Fig. a and b) using continuous 3–0 surgipro sutures (Covidien, Surgipro II).
During the anastomosis, the patients were ventilated intermittently through right main bronchus intubation across the surgical field (Fig. ): the ventilation tube was inserted into the distal end of the divided right main bronchus for SPO2 to reach 100 %, so it can be withdrawn and the anastomosis can be performed starting from the posterior wall of the trachea. Once the SPO2 drops below 90 %, the surgeon should stop and reinsert the tube to elevate the SPO2 again and continue the anastomosis. Roughly, it takes 3 cycles to complete the anastomosis. When the anastomosis was completed, the surgical-field endotracheal intubation was replaced with orotracheal intubation, with the endotracheal tube passing through the anastomosis site and into the right main bronchus.
Azygos vien was transected after ligation. While its distal end was ligated, the other end was incised longitudinally to be used as a pedicle flap (Fig. d) to encircle the site of anastomosis. Freeing the left main bronchus from the surrounding was additionally done to prepare for VATS left pneumonectomy.
When the operation on the right side was completed, VATS and left sleeve pneumonectomy were performed with the patients in the right lateral position. Four thoracic ports were used for left thoracoscopy: The camera port was located at the 8th intercostal space in posterior axillary line, the major operating port between the 4th and 6th intercostal space in anterior axillary line, and an assistant port at the 7th intercostal space in scapular line (Fig. a). Since the left main bronchus had been dissociated freely and the subcarinal lymph nodes had been dissected during the right thoracotomy, the left sleeve pneumonectomy was performed after dividing the left pulmonary artery and vein with linear staplers. In addition, the left hilar lymph nodes and the lymph nodes at stations 5–9 were dissected (Fig. b).
The total operating hours of two cases were 5.5 h and 6 h separately. In the first case, the right thoracotomy took 3.5 h and VATS left pneumonectomy took 2 h, while the first stage of the other case lasted for 4 h and the second one lasted for 2 h.
Surgical outcomes and follow-up: For the first patient, postoperative histopathological examination of the surgical specimens revealed an adenoid cystic carcinoma in the left main bronchus, tumor-free margins, and metastasis-free lymph nodes at each station examined. The pathological stage was pT4N0M0, IIIA (7th UICC guidelines, 2009). Histopathological examination in the second patient revealed a moderately-to-poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma in the left lung with metastasis to the lymph nodes on the left side at station 8 (1/1), station 10 (1/8), and station 7 (1/1). The other lymph nodes and the section margins were negative for cancer cells. The pathological stage was pT4N2M0, IIIB (7th UICC guidelines, 2009).","

CR_ENG_82,English,"A 30-year-old man was referred with a history of chronic intermittent abdominal pain. He had lost weight considerably for about 4 months. According to the physical examination,
except for the epigastric tenderness, there was no other point. He was anemic and his hemoglobin level was 9 g/dL.
He was totally normal in terms of the basic serological tests. His liver tests as well as imaging examinations including abdomen radiography and ultrasonography, celiac serology, thyroid function tests, and pancreatic enzyme tests were normal. Since he has lost weight significantly, an Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was subsequently performed. The results showed nodular and erythematous mucosa of the stomach and duodenum ().
In a histological examination of gastric biopsy samples, no specific finding but chronic gastritis was reported. Colonoscopy was normal. He was prescribed proton pump inhibitors for 3 months. After a 3-month treatment, the patient’s abdominal pain slightly improved but continued. Therefore, again upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed. The appearance of the endoscopy did not improve and gastric mucosal biopsy showed marked thickening of sub-epithelial basement membrane in antral mucosa (X100, H&E stain, ) and moderately severe atrophy of glandular component of antrum (x100, H&E, ). He was diagnosed as having collagenous gastritis. An autoimmune evaluation was not positive.","

CR_ENG_83,English,"In October 2014, a 46-year-old White male presented to clinic with recent history of rapidly growing, painful swelling in left axilla. He was referred by his GP to Melanoma clinic in view that in February 2010 he had a wide local excision of malignant melanoma on his right upper back with 0.72mm Breslow thickness. Swelling in the axilla has been present for 3 months, and he first noticed it during game of tennis. On presentation the patient was systemically well and had no co-morbidities, no other past medical history and no family history of melanoma, however he reported occasional prolonged sun exposure during holidays and mild sun burns in the past. He is a non-smoker and alcohol consumption was mild.
On examination he had a 10 cm firm swelling under left axilla with no obvious surface skin changes. There was no other palpable lymphadenopathy.
An ultrasound and fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the mass, confirmed metastatic melanoma with a BRAF V600E mutation. He underwent further scanning to identify any other lesions. Results of brain MRI were normal and PET-CT showed a large FDG avid axillary mass () likely to represent a lymph node with no metabolically active primary lesion.
Given the size and location of the mass, it was not amenable for safe surgical resection without significant risk of morbidity. It was decided to commence systemic treatment with the BRAF inhibitor, Dabrafenib.
Four month following commencement of systemic therapy there was a significant reduction in size of the lesion that made it suitable and safe for surgical resection. Patient was scheduled on the elective list for axillary node clearance and was operated by Consultant Plastic surgeon, procedure was uncomplicated and patient was discharged home the following day. Specimen was sent to histopathology laboratory and subsequently been reported as no malignancy. This was a complete response to Dabrafenib. It was decided to continue with Dabrafenib to complete a full year of therapy.
Patient was regularly followed up in Oncology and Plastic surgery clinics and had yearly PET-CT scans (, ) that showed no metastatic disease. Overall recovery was smooth and uncomplicated.
Following 2 years of remission, the patient re-presented with a palpable infraclavicular lymph node. Lesion was small and amenable for surgical excision, following surgical procedure patient completed a course of radiotherapy.
Currently, the patient is completing systemic therapy with Pembrolizumab without any toxic side effects. He continues to be in remission with negative follow up scans.","

The patient reported gradual lethargy, mild confusion and decreased attention, as well as urinary frequency and constipation. She denied any pulmonary symptoms. She was undergoing outpatient work-up for hypercalcaemia of uncertain aetiology. The highest recorded serum calcium on routine labs was 11.9 mg/dL in the setting of mildly worsening kidney function ( reports serum laboratory studies during clinical course). The parathyroid hormone level was low at 8 pg/mL and parathyroid hormone-related peptide and 25 hydroxyvitamin D were normal. The angiotensin-converting enzyme level was mildly high at 71 U/L (8–53) in the setting of a normal 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D level. A computed tomography chest done six months prior to the current hospitalisation for the complaint of shortness of breath showed mild bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis bilaterally with mucous plugging and subcentimeter noncalcified nodules in tree-in-bud distributions that was thought consistent with Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection or colonisation with superimposed congestive heart failure exacerbation. Her dyspnea resolved and therefore treatment for Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare was not initiated.
Her home medications were carvedilol, vitamin B12, duloxetine, fentanyl patch, hydrocodone/acetaminophen, furosemide, potassium chloride and a multivitamin. She had scattered crackles on pulmonary examination and normal oxygen saturation on room air. Serum calcium level at admission was 12.8 mg/dL. Other notable initial laboratory findings included creatinine 2.4 mg/dL and BUN 54 mg/dL. Serum white blood cell count and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Initial chest X-ray () showed diffuse patchy opacities. Computed tomography chest () showed extensive tree-in-bud-type micronodularity predominantly in the upper lobes, as well as a 1-cm nodule in the right upper lobe, and underlying bronchiectasis and bronchiolectasis. Computed tomography abdomen/pelvis was grossly unremarkable and not indicative of any malignancy. Serum and urine electrophoresis and skeletal survey were unremarkable. Twenty-four hour urine calcium level was within normal limits. Bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cultures grew Mycobacterium avium complex, with biopsies showing some non-necrotising granulomas. Other bronchoalveolar lavage studies, including Coccidioidomycosis polymerase chain reaction, Mycobacterium tuberculosis Polymerase chain reaction and Nocardia smear, were negative. The patient was treated with prednisone and her calcium normalised. She was discharged on gradual prednisone taper and required continued low dose prednisone outpatient to suppress her hypercalcaemia.

She denied chest pain but admitted to having orthopnea and paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea associated with productive cough with whitish frothy sputum.
On examination, she appeared vitally stable but lethargic and could answer questions comfortably. We noted jugular venous distention along with hepatojugular reflux. On cardiac examination, we noted irregular rhythm and holosystolic murmur in the left sternal border. An exam of her lower extremities revealed edema (+2). An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed low voltage with controlled atrial fibrillation (Figure ). Her bedside echocardiogram showed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction of 25%, with concentric hypertrophy (Figure ). Table presents the results of her laboratory investigations.
She was admitted as a case of uncompensated congestive heart failure. The management plan focused on stabilizing the patient, treating her acute decompensation, and eventual referral to a specialized cardiology center for further investigation and optimization. We started her on diuretics, and the nephrologist started hemodialysis, given the patient's worsening renal function and volume overload. Her acute decompensation improved following dialysis, and the patient was discharged home with instructions to follow-up with her cardiologist and nephrologist. In her cardiology follow-up, the patient was diagnosed with suspected cardiac amyloidosis, but the patient refused further investigation.","

CR_ENG_86,English,"A 20-year-old female patient presented with a request to discuss the options for prosthetic replacement of mandibular left first molar which was extracted 6 months back. Clinical examination revealed a mesioangular impacted tooth third molar which was advised to be extracted. After two months, the patient reported back again for the prosthetic replacement of the molar (Figures and ). There was no significant past or present medical history and oral hygiene was acceptable. Prior to the surgical procedure, the patient was instructed to rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine gluconate (Hexidine, ICPA Health Products Ltd., India) for one minute. The surgical protocols emphasized complete asepsis and infection control. The type of implant used was an acid-etched, tapered self threaded implant (HI-Tec) of diameter 4.5 × 13 mm. Briefly, after induction of local anesthesia, a crystal incision was made along the crest of the ridge using Bard-Parker number 12 surgical blade, bisecting the existing keratinized mucosa (). A full thickness mucoperiosteal flap was raised buccally and lingually to the level of mucogingival junction, exposing the underlined ridge of the implant site, and a ridge alveoplasty was performed with the help of 0.2 mm round bur to achieve a flat bone surface of sufficient width (). A surgical drill guide was used for the precise placement of the pilot drill. After pilot drill application, the implant site was prepared with the corresponding size of parallel drill (). The implants were placed in the recipient site by means of an insertion device, and a torque driver set at 35 N cm which was used to evaluate primary stability of implant (). It was the level of torque that the manufacturer recommended to be applied to the implant. To detect and prevent unfavorable rotation of implant, the implant was secured through a mounting sleeve that allowed manual detection of rotation. The appropriate position of the implant neck in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions was decisive. The implant neck was positioned at the crystal bone level or slightly submerged (). Immediately after implant placement, the flap was replaced in its original position and sutured with nonresorbable suture (4-0) using a combination of inverted mattress and interrupted sutures. The inverted mattress sutures kept the bleeding edges of the flap close together, while the interrupted sutures sealed the edges. Intraoral periapical radiograph was taken immediately after surgery ().","

CR_ENG_88,English,"A 63-year-old woman with an impression of a recurrent tumor was admitted with a chief complaint of shortness of breath 10 months after surgery for cardiac leiomyosarcoma. In her past medical history, she had undergone surgery for the removal of leiomyosarcoma in the main pulmonary artery at a different hospital, where she had been admitted with a chief complaint of dyspnea (New York Heart Association Functional Classification II-III). In addition, she did not have hypertension or diabetes mellitus, other than the previous cardiac surgery.
Upon admission, her blood pressure was 130/90, and her heart rate was 90 beats/min showing a sinus rhythm. Her height, body weight, and body mass index were 160 cm, 60 kg, and 24.4 kg/m2, respectively. The blood test taken upon her admission showed creatine kinase-MB 2.5 and troponin-I <0.02, which were within normal levels. Arterial blood gas analysis revealed pH 7.48, PO2 61.3 mmHg, PCO2 27.2 mmHg, and O2 saturation 92.3%.
In her chest X-ray, no cardiomegaly was observed, but patchy haziness of the right middle lobe was seen. The cardiac computed tomography (CT) showed a massive amount of thromboembolism in the pulmonary trunk, right pulmonary artery, and left anteromedial basal segment artery (). Lung cancer, pulmonary infarction, myocardial infarction, and coronary artery disease were not observed. Because of a suspicion of recurrent leiomyosarcoma, a surgical resection was decided upon (preoperative echocardiogram was not carried out). There was no evidence of lung metastasis in CT; therefore, lobectomy of the lung was not considered.
After carrying out median sternotomy, cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated. Transverse pulmonary arteriotomy was performed in the area straight above the pulmonary valve. Then, a mass with a volume of 4×4×3.5 cm hanging on the pulmonary valve with a stalk was observed. The mobile gelatinous mass was hanging loosely in the right ventricular outflow track (RVOT), infundibulum, and main pulmonary artery. The incision of the right pulmonary artery was made up to the superior vena cava. An incision of the left pulmonary artery was extended to the first bifurcation area. Then, the myxoid mass was resected (). The sufficient back flow from the distal pulmonary artery was verified in both the right and the left pulmonary arteries. The harvested greater saphenous vein graft was used for the reconstruction and widening of the main pulmonary artery and left pulmonary artery. Because the myxoid mass had a well-defined capsule and stalk, we thought that there was no invasion to the nearby apparatus; therefore, we decided upon a pulmonary valve preservation operation.
The duration of extracorporeal circulation was 235 minutes, while that of aortic cross clamping was 85 minutes. Extubation was carried out 12 hours after surgery, and the patient was transferred to a general ward on the fifth postoperative day. Cardiac CT performed on the seventh postoperative day confirmed that there was no remnant mass in the pulmonary trunk, RVOT, or in either of the pulmonary arteries (). The patient was discharged on the fourteenth postoperative day without any complications.
Three months after hospital discharge, she again developed dizziness and palpitation, and an echocardiogram was carried out and showed a generally hypoechoic and heterogeneous mass. The CT images showed a 2.5×2.8 cm mass at the base of the interventricular septum of the RVOT, as well as redundant movements in the direction of the pulmonary artery (). As anticipated, the right ventricular systolic pressure increased to 70 to 75 mmHg. Upon the suspicion of recurrent cardiac leiomyosarcoma, we decided on a radical resection of the tumor.
Transverse pulmonary arteriotomy under cardiopulmonary bypass was performed in the area directly above the pulmonary valve. A gelatinous capsular mass causing RVOT obstruction was removed in the pulmonary valve and subvalvar infundibulum. Then, the transvalvar RVOT reconstruction was performed using a Prima plus 25 mm valve, and the vascular graft after the pulmonary valve was removed. The duration of extracorporeal circulation was 117 minutes. The postoperative course was uneventful, and an echocardiogram performed on the sixth postoperative day did not show a mass in the RVOT and revealed a well-functioning pulmonic valve. The images of cardiac CT carried out on the eighth postoperative day showed no residual mass of the pulmonary trunk, RVOT, or in either of the pulmonary arteries (). The patient was discharged from the hospital on the tenth postoperative day.
During the follow-up six months after hospital discharge, a chest CT disclosed findings that leiomyosarcoma metastasized to left upper lobe (lingular segment) and left lower lobe (). Lingular segmentectomy and lower lobectomy were decided upon and performed under thoracotomy. A tumor 3×3×3 cm in size, dwelling apart from the pulmonary artery, was observed in the lingular segment of the left upper lobe. Another tumor mass with a size of approximately 3.5×3×3 cm was found in the anterior basal segment of the left lower lobe, for which lingular segmentectomy and lower lobectomy were carried out. The patient was discharged from the hospital 10 days after surgery. She has been asymptomatic and free of recurrence for 36 months after the last operation.","

CR_ENG_89,English,"A 4.5-year-old unconscious boy was admitted to hospital with diagnosis of disseminated varicella infection, sepsis, and secondary staphylococci infection, and he was transferred to the intensive care unit because of loss of consciousness. Since spontaneous respiration was weak he was intubated and required mechanical ventilatory support till his death. Ten days before admission he had a history of otherwise uncomplicated mild chicken pox together with three of his siblings. He had been treated with antipyretics and antipruritic lotions but not acyclovir. There was no vesicular eruption. Three days before hospitalization swelling and bluish discoloration developed on his right forearm and 2 days later it ulcerated [].
Physical examination revealed high-grade fever, hypotension, and severe dehydration. Lungs were clear to auscultation bilaterally. There was hepatomegaly and abnormal bilateral extensor plantar response was elicited. There was no neck stiffness. On dermatologic examination excoriated papules with serohemorrhagic crusts 1-3 mm in size scattered over his face, trunk, and extremities were noted. On the flexor surface of the right forearm a sharply bordered plaque with hemorrhagic necrotic crust and deep ulceration was present. His past medical history was unremarkable.
On laboratory tests coagulation screening revealed high d-Dimer (30 ng/ml; cut-off, <0.5 ng/ml), fibrinogen (465 mg/dl; normal level (nl), 200-400 mg/dl) levels and prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (41.6 seconds; nl: 25-40), protrombine time (55 seconds; nl: 70) and they remained unchanged in following days. The complete blood count showed elevation of white blood cells (first day: 9200/mm3, second day: 17 000/mm3; nl: 4000-11000/mm3) and thrombocytopenia (first day: 133000/mm3, second day: 94 000/mm3; nl: 150-400 000/mm3).
Alanine aminotransferase (first day: 324 U/l, second day: 479; nl, N: 0-41 U/l) and aspartate aminotransferase (first day: 1402 U/l, second day: 1082; nl, N:0-37 U/l) were high and kept rising later. On second day creatine kinase (CK) (35981 U/l; nl, 38-174 U/l), CK-MB (1227 U/l; nl, 0-24 U/l), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (5372 U/l; nl, 340-480 U/l), sedimantation (42 mm/h; nl, 1-20 mm/h), and C-reactive protein (238 mg/l; nl, 0-5 mg/l) were high. On urinalysis there were 5 erythrocyte, 7 leukocyte, and 200 mg/dl protein (normal; 0-4 erythrocytes, 0-4 leukocytes, and negative protein). VZV immunglobuline M was positive. TORCH panel, hepatitis markers (HbsAg, anti HCV), and anti-HIV are negative.
The patient was diagnosed as having varicella complicating with purpura fulminans, hepatitis, and probable rhabdomyolysis. The patient was monitorized and intubated. He was started on vancomycin (60 mg/kg, four times a day), cefotaxime (200 mg/kg, three times a day), and acyclovir (15 mg/kg three times a day) treatment. Topical silver sulfadiazine cream was applied two times a day on arm lesions.
Unfortunately, he died in the morning of 4th day after admission. Hemorrhagic necrotic ulcerative plaque did neither expand nor did spread to other parts of body.","

CR_ENG_90,English,"A 31-year-old African American female presented to the hospital with palpitations, shortness of breath, and weakness. She had a known history of Graves’ disease but was non-compliant with medications. She complained of palpitations over the last several weeks and noticed her eyes were turning yellow during this time frame. On examination, the patient did not appear to be in any distress, blood pressure was 151/92 mmHg, heart rate was 122 bpm, and respiratory rate was 22 breath per minute. She had icteric sclera, exophthalmos, and lid lag. Also, she had an enlarged goiter that measured 4 x 5 cm in size. The goiter was shaped like a butterfly, it was symmetrical, it involved bilateral anterior triangles of the neck, it was firm to palpation, it moved with deglutition, its borders were well defined, and it was non-tender. Furthermore, she had distended neck veins but no lymphadenopathy. Abdominal examination revealed a distended abdomen with positive fluid shift and palpable liver 3 cm below the right costal margin along with the midclavicular line. Furthermore, she had 3+ bilateral lower extremity edema and fine resting tremors.
Laboratory investigation revealed total bilirubin of 13 mg/dL, direct bilirubin of 8.6 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase (ALP) of 167 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) of 55 mg/dL, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) of 22 mg/dL. International normalized ratio (INR) was mildly elevated at 1.5. Thyroid-stimulating hormone was 0.0006 mIU/mL, free T4 was 7.44 ng/dL, and free T3 was 6.25 nmol/L. See Table for further lab values. Antinuclear antibody, antimitochondrial antibody, antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody, hepatitis B surface antigen, hepatitis B surface antibody, hepatitis C antibody, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were all negative. Ceruloplasmin and alpha-1 antitrypsin were slightly elevated.
Abdominal ultrasound showed mild hepatomegaly with a heterogeneous liver, distended inferior vena cava, and hepatic vein findings suspicious for congestive hepatomegaly. A CT scan was performed, which showed severe generalized anasarca and a small amount of abdominal ascites as well as a moderate amount of pelvic ascites, as shown in Figure . The liver appeared to be moderately heterogeneous with an ill-defined focal load.
Echocardiogram showed left ventricle ejection fraction of 60%, right ventricle systolic pressure (RVSP) of 58.18 mmHg (normal is <35 mmHg), and moderate tricuspid regurgitation. Thyroid uptake scan from previous outpatient clinic data had shown diffuse increase uptake.
The patient was diagnosed with atrial fibrillation with a rapid ventricular rate secondary to thyrotoxicosis. Also, she was found to have pulmonary hypertension with right-sided heart failure and cholestatic liver injury. She was treated with propranolol, methimazole, furosemide, dexamethasone, and iodine. In the subsequent follow-ups at 1 week, 2 weeks, and 10 weeks, she had resolution of cholestatic hepatic injury as well as improvement of right-sided heart failure.","

CR_ENG_91,English,"A 29-year-old woman with a history of peripartum cardiomyopathy was referred to our clinic for heart failure and severe MR. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated a dilated left ventricle with decreased systolic function (ejection fraction: 25%) and severe MR (vena contracta: 8 mm, effective regurgitant orifice area: 0.33 cm2, regurgitant volume: 52 mL, and regurgitant jet area: 12 cm2). Subsequent transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) confirmed the presence of severe MR between A2–P2 scallops and mild-to-moderate MR between A3–P3 scallops (). MitraClip procedure for severe MR was planned in order to improve her symptoms while waiting for a suitable donor.
A total of four MitraClip devices were implanted to reduce MR. The first MitraClip device was implanted in relation to the origin of the main regurgitant jet, between A2 and P2 scallops. Unfortunately, MR reduction was still not satisfactory after implantation of the second device. The third MitraClip device was implanted lateral to the first one with residual 2+ MR. We planned to terminate the procedure at that moment; however, after several minutes, TEE revealed severe MR due to detachment of the third MitraClip device from the posterior leaflet. Then, a fourth clip was implanted in order to stabilize the third clip. However, there was still a residual 3+ MR on the final control. Mean transmitral gradient was 6 mm Hg after implantation of the fourth MitraClip device. The patient refused to undergo further operation because of its high risk.
During follow-up periods at 1, 3, and 6 months after the procedure, TTE showed that three MitraClips were anchored to their site, whereas one MitraClip was solely attached to the anterior leaflet and MR remained to be 3+ (). After 1 year, she was admitted to our hospital with worsening heart failure symptoms. Chest X-ray showed an embolized MitraClip in her right axilla (). The patient reported no symptoms in the right upper extremity. Any vascular events related to embolized clip have not occurred since then.","

CR_ENG_92,English,"A 66-year-old man with past medical history of atrial fibrillation and hypertension presented to the emergency room of the EOVA with a two-day history of shortness of breath. He was recently hospitalized for right-sided hemicolectomy due to a tubular adenoma in the cecum. On physical examination he had a temperature of 99.4°F, heart rate of 100 beats per minute, respiratory rate of 20 breath per minute, and oxygen saturation on 97% on 2 liters nasal cannula. Breath sounds were decreased on the right lower lung field and his abdomen revealed a well-healed surgical scar without any surrounding erythema. Laboratory workup showed a WCB of 12.3 × 109/L, with 83% neutrophils. A portable CXR showed a large right-sided pleural effusion that was drained through a chest tube. Pleural fluid analysis was consistent with a transudate and pleural fluid cultures were negative. Three days later, the patient had a temperature of 101.8°F with complains of dysuria, his white blood cell count increased to 14.4 × 109/L and urine analysis showed 30–49 WBC/HPF. Of note, a Foley catheter had been placed on admission but was removed 48 hours later. Ciprofloxacin was empirically started for urinary tract infection; however, he continued to have fevers up to 102°F, was tachycardic, and had persistent dysuria. Urine culture and blood cultures grew multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Ciprofloxacin was changed to doripenem 1 gram IV every 12 hours, (infused over 3 hours), rifampin 300 mg orally every 12 hours and polymyxin B 250,000 units IV every 12 hours adjusted for a creatinine clearance of 42 mL/min.

CR_ENG_94,English,"A 53-year-old woman from Ghana was referred for severe insulin resistance, treatment-resistant hypertension and dyslipidemia. She was first diagnosed with type 2 diabetes at age 40 and was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents until age 51 when insulin was added. She presented to the emergency room with exertional chest heaviness, dyspnea, and epigastric discomfort, however no definite cardiac event was diagnosed. She had a history of burning pain and numbness in her feet, diffuse muscle pains consistent with a chronic pain syndrome, and bilateral frozen shoulders. The patient has a strong family history for early coronary heart disease: her father had a myocardial infarction (MI) in his early 60s, her mother had three MIs, one sister had coronary artery bypass surgery in her 40s and another sister had an MI in her 30s. The patient's only family history of diabetes was in her maternal grandfather's brother.
Current medications included 120 units of insulin daily, amlodipine, valsartan, hydrochlorothiazide, rosuvastatin, ezetimibe, metformin, enteric coated acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), rabeprazole, amitriptyline, meloxicam, K-lyte, and magnesium.
On physical examination, she had a typical Dunnigan-type lipodystrophic habitus, including lipoatrophy of the lower extremities but sparing of fat deposits in the abdominal region, face and neck. Although the age of onset of her lipodystrophy is not known, she has had the same physiognomy for most of her adult life. Her radial pulse was 70 beats/minute and blood pressure was 150/85 mmHg. Her weight was 61.8 kg, height 162 cm, and body mass index 23.5 kg/m2. On cardiovascular examination, soft bruits were heard over both carotids, a 2/6 systolic ejection murmur was heard over the pericardial region and transient pitting edema of the lower extremities was detected bilaterally. On neurological examination, she had absent ankle jerk reflexes and decreased sensation in the area of the upper shin. She had marked acanthosis nigricans on the back of her neck. No other pertinent findings were observed on physical examination; specifically no ocular, dermatological, or abdominal findings.
Her laboratory results included (reference range) fasting glucose of 8.8 mmol/L (4.0-6.0 mmol/L), glycated hemoglobin 16.9% (4.1-6.5%), total cholesterol 7.2 mmol/L (4.3-6.5 mmol/L), triglycerides 3.35 mmol/L (0.67-3.15 mmol/L), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL) 4.8 mmol/L (2.3-4.3 mmol/L), HDL 0.9 mmol/L (1.0-2.4 mmol/L). Cardiac investigations, including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, exercise and pharmacological stress echocardiogram, gated single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) perfusion study, cardiac catheterization and coronary angiography, were all negative specifically showing no significant ischemia or coronary artery disease.
The patient was found to carry no mutation in any of the known lipodystrophy-causing genes (LMNA, PPARG, BSCL, AGPAT2, LMNB2, CAV1) by exon-by-exon sequence analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes and 250 ng was used in each genotyping assay. The high-density oligonucleotide microarrays (chips) used for analysis were the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500 K array set (Santa Clara, CA, USA). The chips were processed using established protocols in the London Regional Genomics Centre. Copy number determination was performed using 130 normal controls and 40 lipodystrophy cases (Figure ) with Partek Genomics Suite version 6.3 (St Louis, MO, USA). No log transformations or data normalizations were used, but probes were corrected for fragment length, sequence, and guanine-cytosine (GC) content. Two CNVs were identified within the genome of the patient: three copies of the entire X chromosome, and a duplication of 89 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes over 415 kb of chromosome 5q33.2, from 154,979 kb to 155,394 kb (physical position, NCBI reference build 36.2). No genes were found in or within 300 kb of the 5q33.2 duplication. Neither the duplication of 5q33.2, nor triple X syndrome, was identified in any of the other lipodystrophy patients or normal controls.","

CR_ENG_97,English,"A 59-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus type II, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease status post right foot amputation, and ESRD on hemodialysis was admitted to our hospital in October of 2017 for chest pain and swelling of legs for 5 days. Notably, the patient is a resident of Puerto Rico, but due to delays caused by Hurricane Maria, was unable to receive his last three dialysis sessions. As a result, 3 days prior to admission, the patient travelled to the continental United States to obtain dialysis.
In the emergency department, the patient had a temperature of 36.8 °C, blood pressure of 180/83, heart rate of 84, respiratory rate of 20, oxygen saturation of 96%, and was found to have lower extremity edema and right stump ulceration with distal necrotic tissue. Labs revealed a potassium level of 5.1, blood urea nitrogen of 67, anion gap of 9, creatinine of 9.990 and a Troponin T of 0.21. An electrocardiogram did not show peaked T-waves. The patient was admitted to reinstate dialysis and rule out acute coronary syndrome. Chest pain resolved after dialysis, and troponins trended down. It was concluded that the mild troponin elevation was likely demand ischemia secondary to fluid overload. To manage the right foot ulcer noted on admission, podiatry was consulted and recommended wound care services for the patient. Social work also recommended outpatient transportation to dialysis given his limited mobility. The patient was then medically cleared for discharge 2 days after admission, after five inpatient dialysis sessions.
Given the recommendation for these outpatient services, social work was consulted for discharge planning. Though the patient was insured through Puerto Rican managed Medicare, the patient’s coverage was not transferable for these services in the continental United States. The team consulted a hospital financial officer who found that to be eligible for New York State Medicaid, the patient would need to change his social security information, mainly his address, to reflect New York residence. While New York State Medicaid remained a potential option, the application process can take as long as 2 months and requires that the applicant maintain state residence for at least a month. This process was therefore not feasible for our patient who wanted to eventually return to Puerto Rico after being discharged to his parents’ home in Brooklyn. As a result, 9 days after admission, the patient was discharged to his parents’ home with local outpatient dialysis set up, but without access to either outpatient wound care or dialysis transportation. Ultimately, the patient was readmitted back to our hospital a month and a half later for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.","

CR_ENG_98,English,"A 20-year-old nulliparous woman was referred to the Department of Uro-neurology for unexplained urinary incontinence. She experienced incontinence most often with effort or exertion; however, this was particularly worse during coughing from exacerbations of chronic sinusitis. Symptoms were intrusive and she was requiring to use as many as 10 incontinence pads a day. In addition to this complaint, she also used to experience urinary urgency associated occasionally with incontinence, as well as urinary frequency, visiting the toilet once every 20 minutes in the daytime and waking up four times at night. There was no history of haematuria or dysuria, and she did not experience urinary tract infections.
She also reported constipation, and would open her bowels only once every three days and with rare episodes of faecal incontinence. She had symptoms akin to irritable bowel syndrome, with frequent abdominal bloating relieved by passing stools.
There was no evident urogenital prolapse. To evaluate her mixed incontinence, she had videourodynamics carried out (Figure ). Screening showed a normal bladder outline which was normally sited and a closed bladder neck at rest. There was evidence for detrusor overactivity during the filling phase. When lying supine, coughing did not lead to any leakage of urine. When standing, asking the patient to cough produced descent of the bladder base with opening of the bladder neck, which led to incontinence. When she was asked to cough during the filling phase, there was evidence of beaking of the bladder neck, demonstrating urethral hypermobility. This was responsible for her stress incontinence. The patient voided a volume of 400 mL with a maximum flow rate (Qmax) of 61 mL/s and no postvoid residual.
In view of the finding of urethral hypermobility, she was further asked about a possible disorder of collagen and, indeed, she gave a history of recurrent shoulder joint dislocation. She was seen by a rheumatology consultant and the patient was confirmed to have a BJHS. Diagnosis of this condition is made on clinical grounds using the Brighton criteria which assesses joint extensibility as well as associated symptoms that contribute to the syndrome (Table ). A Beighton score of 4 (incorporated into the Brighton criteria) or more and longstanding generalized arthralgia, contribute major factors on the overall Brighton criteria. Associated symptoms contribute minor factors. A score of two major criteria, one major criteria and two minor criteria, or two minor criteria and an affected first-degree relative determines a diagnosis of BJHS.
The patient was found to be hypermobile bilaterally in thumbs, elbows, knees and lumbar spine, giving her a Beighton score of 7 out of 9. Her history was also positive for the major criteria of arthalgia for at least three months in four or more joints, with reported generalized aching and lower back pain. She also fulfilled a minor criterion with her history of recurrent dislocations of the shoulder. Of note, the patient's skin was not considered to be overly stretchable.
To understand the cause for her detrusor overactivity, a magnetic resonance imaging of her spine was performed to look for any evidence for spinal cord compression from vertebral subluxation or atlantoaxial dislocation, which may accompany disorders of collagen, and this was normal.
The patient is on regular follow-up with the Uro-neurology and Rheumatology Departments. Pelvic floor exercises have been started to strengthen her pelvic floor and prevent stress incontinence, and an antimuscarinic, solifenacin, for her symptoms of urgency. She has been started on laxatives for her constipation. For the management of her joint condition, a home exercise programme was developed by a physiotherapist to improve core stability, balance and muscle strength. She was also given advice on general fitness training to counter the effects of deconditioning. These measures should prevent future injury through dislocation and help to manage arthralgia.","

CR_ENG_100,English,"A twenty-year-old woman was admitted to the hospital with complaints of cough, fever, palpitations, and chest pain. It was learned that, four years ago the patient had been diagnosed with Behcet's disease and received irregular colchicine treatment. During interviews, we learned that, he had recurrent oral and genital ulcers. On examination, there was no pathological finding except for high temperature (38.5°C). Her chest radiogram showed bilateral, hilar enlargement and peripheral but localized patchy infiltration (). Initial diagnosis of pulmonary artery aneurysm and pulmonary emboli were especially associated with the hilar enlargement and previous diagnosis of Behcet's disease. Accordingly, dynamic contrasted CT was obtained. On dynamic thorax computed tomograms of both pulmonary arteries, aneurysmal dilatation and chronic thrombus involving all interior lmen of both pulmonary arteries were detected. Consolidated substances were determined on posterobasal segment of the left pulmonary lower lobe with a dimension of 3 × 2 cm related to, newly formed emboli (Figures and ).
On concurrent transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) a bulk with a dimension of 4.5 × 1.6 cm was determined in the right ventricle explaining symptoms of thrombus (). On cardiac MRI, a mass lesion was detected in the right ventricle with the dimensions of 4.5 × 1.5 cm concordant with the thrombus. Thrombus was determined in the bilateral femoral veins by venous Doppler ultrasonography of the lower extremities. Hematologic parameters of the patient were within the normal limits. Thrombophilia panel was reported as normal. The patient was referred to an ophthalmologist who found evidence of active uveitis.
Pulsed immunosuppressive therapy was administered to the patient. She was quickly relieved of her symptoms after a combination therapy with methylprednisolone, cyclophosphamide, and low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH).
Significant improvement of the laboratory parameters of the patient was obtained (). Dynamic thorax CT was repeated at the end of the 3rd month of the treatment. Partial dissolution of the thrombi and pulmonary defects were observed. Besides, an irregular hypodense defect with irregular contours with its largest diameter comparatively regressed from 3 cm to 2 cm was observed. The diameter of the pulmonary truncus which was previously 29 mm measured 23 mm on control CT, and minimisation of the mass lesion in the right ventricle was observed (Figures , , , and ). Doppler USG demonstrated disappearance of the previously detected thrombus in femoral veins.

The next day, D-dimer was elevated to 12, and patient was transitioned to apixaban. On day 30, she was extubated, and six days later, the patient developed paraplegia. Prior to admission, she denied neurological deficits or back pain. CT of lumbar and thoracic spine showed a 1.6 cm ring-enhancing collection in the right lung concerning for abscess at the T5-T6 vertebral levels (Figure ).
MRI of thoracic spine with contrast showed circumferential enhancement around the T5 and T6 vertebral bodies, and moderate anterior-posterior epidural enhancement with cord-compression consistent with epidural abscess (Figure ).
She was taken for washout, fusion, and decompression of the affected spine by neurosurgery. Purulent discharge and phlegmon with significant stenosis were noted at T5-6 epidural space. Samples from surgery grew Staphylococcus capitis. Post-operatively, she had improvement in lower extremity strength and sensation. She was transferred to a rehabilitation facility, and at one-month follow-up she was able to move her lower extremities.","

CR_ENG_103,English,"A 71-year-old female patient with an unresectable malignant hilar cholangiocarcinoma (Klatskin tumor) associated with a direct bilirubin level of 22 mg/dL and dilation of intrahepatic biliary ducts () underwent palliative percutaneous bilateral external biliary drainage. After 5 days, the two external biliary drainages were replaced by two plastic biliary endoprostheses 12-Fr (Boston Scientific, Natick, MA), as a palliative treatment (). Three months later, she was evaluated for a mild dilatation of left intrahepatic biliary ducts and left percutaneous access biliary leak. The left biliary endoprosthesis appeared occluded at its proximal third and proximally migrated due to tumour growth (). Due to the proximal displacement of the left biliary endoprosthesis and the presence of the biliary leak, we decided to accede it percutaneously. After removing the left subcutaneous fixing ring, from the left percutaneous previous access (through the percutaneous biliary leak), we have passed a guide wire through the endoprosthesis from the proximal tip to first lateral hole because the endoprosthesis was occluded further this hole. An 8 Fr diameter introducer sheath (Terumo, Tokyo, Japan) was positioned. After multiple attempts of endoprosthesis removal by pushing it with the dilatator of the introducer sheath and a 3.5 × 40 mm balloon catheter (Abbott, Beringen, Switzerland) that was inflated coaxially outside the proximal end of the endoprosthesis, we decide to inflate the balloon catheter partially (half of it) inside the proximal end of the endoprosthesis () and to pull back the device through the percutaneous transhepatic access ().

CR_ENG_104,English,"A 60-year-old man with AF was admitted to our hospital after experiencing dyspnea, orthopnea, and a non-productive cough for 2 weeks. The patient had a 10-year history of longstanding persistent AF, four previous radiofrequency catheter ablation procedures (10, 9, and 2 years, and 5 months prior to admission), and a strong family history of AF with ischemic stroke. His CHA2DS2-VASc score was 0 (male, age <60 years old, and no congestive heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke/transient ischemic attack/thromboembolism, or vascular disease), and highly symptomatic paroxysmal AF remained after multiple procedures. Although this patient had undergone his 1st and 2nd procedures at another institute and we have limited information based on the medical record, he did show arrhythmogenic PV triggers from the left upper PV. At the 3rd procedure, we had found reconnected PV potentials at the left superior PV and right inferior PV and noted persistence of AF triggers from the left superior PV. Therefore, we had conducted complete circumferential PV isolation and added linear ablations. However, AF recurred as paroxysmal type. At the 4th procedure, all PV isolations and bidirectional blocks of linear ablation were maintained well, and a complex fractionated atrial electrogram-guided ablation was added (). Although a left upper PV trigger occurred during the first three procedures, we did not confirm the exit block by inside PV pacing at the last procedure. To exclude potential epicardial conduction after circumferential PV isolation, inside PV pacing with maximal electrode contact might be important, especially during repeat procedures. There was no evidence of non-PV triggers after electrical cardioversion under isoproterenol infusion. At that time, 75% luminal narrowing of the left superior PV was noticed, but there were no respiratory symptoms. However, the patient became symptomatic with AF recurrence 5 months later, and 3-dimensional-computed tomography (CT) revealed progression of PV stenosis with a significantly atrophied left atrium (). An increased left superior PV systolic peak flow velocity (251 cm/s) with turbulent flow at the PV ostium was observed on the transesophageal echocardiogram (). Based on the diagnosis of clinically significant left superior PV stenosis (), balloon-expandable stent deployment (10×19 mm, OMNILINK, Abbott Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) after balloon angioplasty (8×20 mm, POWERFLEX, Cordis Inc., Hialeah, FL, USA) () was performed. Sinus rhythm was restored, and the patient exhibited no apparent symptoms related to PV stenosis or AF recurrence 1 day after PV stenting. A follow-up CT performed 12 months after the procedure showed a patent left superior PV (). There was no recurrence of AF based on 24-hour Holter electrocardiogram monitoring based on 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines during regular follow-ups for 2 years ().","

CR_ENG_106,English,"On 6 July 2011, a 22-year-old woman (gravida 4, para 2) was admitted to our hospital with a complaint of amenorrhea for 47 days and irregular vaginal bleeding for half a month. She had had her first pregnancy three years previously, which ended with a full-term vaginal delivery. Her second normal pregnancy ended in an induced abortion in the first trimester two years previously. Her third pregnancy ended in a full-term delivery by Caesarean section in July 2010. She had an inevitable abortion ending in curettage four months previously. Her menstrual cycle was regular (30 days) with seven days duration. Her most recent menstrual period was on 19 May 2011. Bimanual examination revealed a mildly enlarged uterine corpus with an obviously enlarged uterine isthmus and a closed cervical os. A transvaginal sonogram showed a 6.6 × 5.6 × 5.5 cm mass implanted in the anterior wall of the uterine isthmus embedded in and surrounded by myometrium and separated from the endometrial cavity. The lesion was bulging toward the serosa with a thin layer of overlying myometrium (Figure A). Both the uterine cavity and the cervical canal were empty. Pulsed Doppler ultrasonography showed abundant blood flow signals and a low resistive index (RI = 0.38) around the lesion. The results of computed tomography (CT) of the chest and brain were normal. There were no pathologic findings in the upper abdominal ultrasound. The blood level of β-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) was 312,468 IU/l (normal value, <5.3 IU/l) on 6 July 2011.
Because Caesarean scar choriocarcinoma is rare, its clinical diagnosis is very hard to make in a patient without metastasis before a pathological examination. Furthermore, we had no experience of the clinical characteristics and diagnosis of Caesarean scar choriocarcinoma. The patient was diagnosed as having a normal Caesarean scar pregnancy (CSP). After written informed consent was obtained, she was treated with a selective uterine artery embolization (UAE) coupled with an arterial injection of 70 mg of methotrexate (MTX) after a routine clinical and laboratory evaluation on 7 July 2011. The patient underwent careful dilation and curettage (D&C) under transabdominal ultrasound guidance the next day. Bleeding was initially brisk but decreased substantially by the time most adherent tissue had been removed. The curettage specimen consisted of approximately 4.0 × 4.0 × 3.0 cm of necrotic tissue mixed with blood clots. An unusually large anterior uterine wall defect was found on the ultrasonic scan during the operation. The total blood loss was 200 ml and iodoform gauze packing was left in situ for 24 hours to decrease the risk of heavy vaginal bleeding. The patient’s hemodynamic status remained stable during and after the procedure. The postoperative recovery was uneventful, and the patient’s serum β-HCG levels declined from 189,930 IU/l to 110,984 IU/l the day after the operation.
However, transvaginal ultrasonography revealed a 4.7 × 5.7 × 4.5 cm complex mass protruding into the bladder and increased vascularity at the anterior lower uterine wall (RI = 0.29) five days after the D&C (Figure B). A histological examination confirmed the diagnosis of choriocarcinoma. Histology revealed a proliferation of trophoblastic and syncytiotrophoblastic cells with clearly malignant features in the clot, and chorionic villi were not identified (Figure A). Immunohistochemical staining for β-HCG was strongly positive (Figure B), and the Ki-67 index was high in the tumour tissue (Figure C). Human placental lactogen was weakly positive in the tumour tissue (Figure D). The diagnosis of a Caesarean scar choriocarcinoma was confirmed on the basis of all the findings. The patient was accepted as International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage I:8 and received eight courses of multiagent chemotherapy (etoposide, actinomycin D, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide and vincristine, EMA/CO). Her progress was monitored with serial weekly blood β-HCG measurements. The β-HCG levels declined from 18,121 IU/l before the first course of EMA/CO therapy to 3.57 IU/l after four cycles of EMA/CO therapy on 8 September 2011. The post-chemotherapy period was excellent, without any major complications.","

CR_ENG_107,English,"A 24-year-old female with Rett syndrome developed recurrent unilateral neck abscesses over a 6-month period.
Rett syndrome is a severe neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by the progressive loss of intellectual functioning, fine and gross motor skills and communicative abilities, deceleration of head growth and the development of stereotypic hand movements, occurring after a period of normal development [].
At initial consult, a 2 cm abcess overlying the left mastoid tip and a bony swelling arising from the EAC with overlying normal skin (Fig. ) obstructing the view of the left ear canal and tympanic membrane was noted. Following incision and drainage of the abscess in theatre, the patient returned 2 weeks later with a self-draining left neck wound. As she was otherwise systemically well, the patient was treated as an outpatient with a course of oral antibiotics and listed for excision of the EAC osteoma and exploration of her left mastoid cavity. Due to the patient's global learning disabilities, audiological assessment and imaging of her ears were only possible under general anaesthesia. A combined decision was taken to proceed to surgical exploration, as it was felt that these adjunctive tests will not impact on her immediate management and would subject the patient to an additional anaesthetic challenge.
At surgery, transmeatal exicision of the EAC osteoma revealed an underlying cholesteatoma that has caused bony erosion of the inferior canal wall (Fig. ) and formed a fistulous connection to the overlying neck skin (Fig. ). The post-aural sinus and fistula were excised through a post-auricular incision. A cortical mastoidectomy was performed to explore the mastoid cavity, which was found to be disease free. The temporalis fascia was harvested and used to reconstruct the inferior canal wall defect. Histopathologic examination of the excised tissues confirmed the synchronous dual pathology involving the EAC (Figs and ).
The patient's symptoms settled after surgery and the neck abscess healed completely. There was no clinically detectable neck disease or cholesteatoma formation in the left ear canal at her 12-month clinic review.","

CR_ENG_109,English,"A 21-year-old female patient presented with instability of the left knee joint. She had no history of trauma but a continued feeling of instability during ambulation and experienced a feeling of giving way about two to three times a month. A physical examination showed no tenderness or swelling, and the range of motion was normal. The patient displayed some positive signs, grade 3 on Lachman's test and the anterior drawer test and grade 2 on the pivot shift test. The side to side difference in the anterior drawer test using the KT-2000 arthrometer was 15.3 mm.
The distal medial condyle of the left femur appeared hypoplastic on conventional radiographs. On scanogram, the left femur (37.8 cm) was shorter than the right femur (39.4 cm), while the left and right tibiae were the same length. Anterior and posterior simple radiographs showed hypoplasia of the left lateral tibial spine and a lateral view showed a decreased posterior tibial slope compared to that of the right side. On the Knee Lachman stress view, the side to side difference between each anterior drawer was determined to be 16.7 mm ().
The ACL was not visible on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans and the posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) also seemed hypoplastic. The medial femoral condyle appeared comparatively smaller, the intercondylar notch was decreased in height and width, and the cartilaginous covering of the lateral intercondylar notch appeared broader compared to normal specimens ().
Reconstructive surgery of the cruciate ligament was planned and arthroscopy was performed. The arthroscopy showed that the ACL was absent, the PCL was maintained, and the lateral femoral intercondylar notch was broadly covered with cartilage as seen on the preoperative MRI. An incomplete longitudinal tear, about 5 mm in size, was observed at the posterior horn of the medial meniscus. It was left in situ because it did not appear to be pathological. Other defects or abnormal signs were not observed. Notchplasty was extensively performed to widen the abnormally narrow femoral intercondylar notch, after which transtibial single-bundle ACL reconstruction was performed using an allograft of the anterior tibialis tendon (). A tibial footprint of 10 mm in diameter was created on the tibial footprint of the ACL. Then, a femoral socket 10 mm in diameter was created at the 1 o'clock position using reamers and dilators with the knee at 90° of flexion. The transplanted tendon was fixed to the proximal tibia using an interference screw and to the distal femur using two Rigidfix Cross Pin devices (DePuy Mitek, Raynham, MA, USA). The reconstruction was completed after normal range of motion and stability of the knee joint were confirmed.
The patient was followed up for 6 months after the knee reconstruction. Examination of the knee range of motion revealed no limitation. The side to side difference in the anterior drawer test using the KT-2000 arthrometer was 3.8 mm and the pivot shift test was negative.","

CR_ENG_110,English,"We report on a 57-year-old gentleman who initially presented with a 6-month history of heavy central chest pain, back and shoulder pain and shortness of breath on exertion (New York Heart Association Classification (NYHA) III, Canadian Cardiovascular Society Angina Classification (CCS) II). He suffered an inferior myocardial infarction in 2007 and has a known bicuspid aortic valve under follow-up. Risk factors for ischaemic heart disease include current smoking and a positive family history of heart disease on his maternal side. On admission, a transoesophageal ECHO (TOE) () and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) () were carried out and demonstrated the bicuspid aortic valve with a mixed stenosis/regurgitation pattern (moderate–severe) (). In addition, marked left ventricular dilatation and an inferior LVA extending from the base to the mid-cavity of the left ventricle measuring 4.5 cm across the orifice () were seen. The aneurysm was thin walled, with dyskinetic motion with evidence of a dense thrombus adherent to the wall. The inferior wall was noted to be akinetic and non-viable. Preoperative LVEF was 60%. The angiogram showed stenosis of the right coronary artery () in the mid-segment together with distal left anterior descending disease ().
The heart was elevated following application of the cross-clamp and the 5-cm posterior aneurysm opened and the thrombus within removed completely (). The aneurysm was excised leaving a 1-cm rim of scar tissue, which was everted, and the defect closed in a linear fashion with double-layered, Teflon-buttressed, 3.0 Prolene sutures (Johnson&Johnson® Medical Devices). The heart was placed in the normal position and the left internal mammary artery was grafted to left anterior descending artery and saphenous vein graft to circumflex artery territory (obtuse marginal 1). An oblique aortotomy was performed; the stenotic aortic valve was excised, and a bioprosthesis was implanted. Post-operatively, systolic function was good together (LVEF 40%) with a well-seated aortic valve showing no paravalvular leaks. The patient was discharged home on the ninth post-operative day with dual antiplatelet therapy but no formal Coumadin-based anticoagulation as this was felt to incur too high a bleeding risk. This was a joint decision between both clinical teams and patient.","

CR_ENG_112,English,"A 47-year old Caucasian man with history of depression and remote polysubstance abuse presented to his primary care physician with two months of cough, dyspnea, and asthenia. Chest radiography demonstrated patchy, diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Chest computed tomography (CT) disclosed diffuse lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and bilateral bronchiectatic changes (Figure ). Body positron emission tomography (PET)/CT showed diffuse, hypermetabolic (mild-moderate 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) uptake) lymphadenopathy without other evidence of malignancy. The initial differential diagnosis included atypical respiratory infection, granulomatous disease, and lymphoproliferative disorder. He underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage, with negative staining for acid-fast bacilli, no malignant cells on cytology, and no growth in bacterial and fungal cultures. Transbronchial lung biopsy revealed non-specific chronic inflammation, and fine needle aspirate of a left neck lymph node was non-diagnostic. A repeat bronchoscopic evaluation nine months later was similarly unrevealing. Serum protein electrophoresis showed no evidence of monoclonal gammopathy, and angiotensin-converting enzyme levels were within normal limits. Serum inflammatory markers were elevated (erythrocyte sedimentation rate 111 mm/hr, C-reactive protein 7.28 mg/dL), but an extensive biochemical evaluation for infectious etiologies, including HIV, tuberculosis, coccidioidomycosis, aspergillosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, and histoplasmosis, was negative. Due to an elevated Strongyloides IgG antibody titer, he was treated with ivermectin but had no improvement in his symptoms.
While this workup was in progress, the patient described progressive memory difficulty and recurrent, stereotyped spells involving perception of an unpleasant odor followed by nausea and dizziness. The spells lasted about one minute, occurred up to seven times per day, and coincided with episodic confusion noticed by his girlfriend. A routine electroencephalogram (EEG) was normal, and the patient was treated empirically with levetiracetam without benefit.
His neurological exam was notable for short-term memory impairment (1 out of 3 object recall after 5-minute delay) and hyporeflexia with length-dependent sensory loss in the lower extremities. Routine bloodwork revealed hyponatremia, with serum sodium of 131 mmol/L. Lumbar puncture was performed, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed glucose 55 mg/dL, total protein 33 mg/dL, and 12/mm3 white blood cells (88% lymphocytes, 11% monocytes) and 15/mm3 red blood cells. CSF cytology was negative. Gadolinium-enhanced brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 3.0 Tesla was normal. Video-EEG monitoring performed over two days captured twelve electrographic seizures—most were subclinical but some had associated dyscognitive features—with ictal onset over the left temporal region (Figure ). Electrographic features of the seizures, including early emergence of rhythmic theta- and alpha-range frequencies, suggested mesial temporal origin. Levetiracetam was substituted with divalproex, which led to complete resolution of the patient’s seizures based both on his report and on repeat video-EEG monitoring one month later. His cognitive deficits also improved subjectively, though formal neuropsychological testing was not pursued.
The constellation of subacute encephalopathy, temporal lobe seizures, and mild lymphocytic CSF pleocytosis raised the possibility of autoimmune encephalitis. Serological analysis revealed elevated voltage-gated potassium channel (VGKC) antibodies (850 pmol/L; Athena Diagnostics, reference range 31–88 pmol/L). Testing for N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and glutamic acid decarboxylase antibodies was negative. VGKC antibodies can be associated with underlying neoplastic disease, and, to further evaluate this possibility, excisional biopsy of a level V lymph node in the right neck was performed.
Histologic sections revealed lymph nodes with variable sized follicles, some with atrophic germinal centers (Figure a). Germinal centers with penetrating vessels were present, conferring a “lollipop” appearance (Figure b). Mantle zone lymphocytes were arranged in concentric rings (“onion-skinning”). The interfollicular areas and medulla were expanded by large sheets of mature plasma cells. No granulomas were seen. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated the presence of polytypic plasma cells. Flow cytometry provided no evidence for a clonal lymphocyte population or aberrant antigen expression. IL-6 concentration in undiluted serum was 7.12 pg/mL (reference range 0.31-5.00 pg/mL) but the level was 174.08 pg/mL when tested in serial dilutions, suggesting prozone effect. Taken together, these results were most consistent with MCD, plasma cell variant. Of note, HHV8 staining of lymphoid tissue and serum HHV8 immunofluorescence assay were both negative. Repeat HIV antibody testing was also negative.
The patient was treated with two four-week cycles of weekly rituximab infusions followed by maintenance rituximab infusions every two months for a planned two-year course. Antiepileptic drug therapy with divalproex was continued with some dose adjustment required for breakthrough seizures. Serum IL-6 levels were not monitored to track response to therapy, but serial PET scans have shown decreased size and FDG-avidity of diffuse lymphadenopathy without complete resolution. A repeat VGKC antibody titer six months after initiation of rituximab was lower but remained elevated at 656 pmol/L. At last follow-up, the patient’s cough was persistent, now being managed with prednisone, but the constitutional symptoms that led to initial presentation had resolved.","

CR_ENG_113,English,"In October 2012, a 49-year-old man was diagnosed with Ph+ B-ALL. At diagnosis, the patient presented with hyperleukocytosis and lymphoblasts expressing B-ALL immunophenotype (CD34+, CD19+, CD20+, CD10+). The Ph+ t(9; 22) translocation () resulted in a p190 protein (e1a2 transcript type), determining a high risk (HR) of disease relapse. The patient did not present any significant comorbidities, and he was enrolled in the NILG ALL10/07 trial () ( and ), combining chemotherapy (idarubicin, cyclophosphamide, 6-mercaptopurine, dexamethasone, and intrathecal chemotherapy) and imatinib (800 mg/day).
The treatment was well tolerated, and the patient obtained a complete morphological, cytogenetic, and molecular response after induction therapy with no significant side effects. In April 2013, the patient underwent allo-SCT from a matched related donor (53-year-old patient’s sister, with no history of neoplasia or hematologic malignancies), considering the HR disease relapse. The conditioning regimen was based on cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg for 2 days (4,800 mg total dose) and total body irradiation (total dose: 1,200 cGy), and he received methotrexate and cyclosporine-A (CyA) for graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis.
In the first 100 days after transplant, the patient developed a WHO grade 4 acute GVHD (aGVHD) () of the skin (stage III), gut (stage II), and liver (stage II). He was treated with steroids (6-methylprednisone 2 mg/kg per day), infliximab (four total doses), and extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), obtaining complete remission.
Four months later, he developed severe chronic GVHD (cGVHD) () involving the skin (score 4), mucous membranes (score 2), eyes (score 1), and joints (score 1). The cGVHD was treated with UVA phototherapy, then with methotrexate, and lastly with imatinib, ECP, and rituximab. The posttransplant course was also characterized by several CMV reactivations and multiple infections of skin ulcers, complicated by recurrent sepsis and one episode of septic shock caused by (July 2018).
During all the follow–up, the patient remained in continuous complete morphological/molecular remission with 100% CD34+ donor chimerism.
Five years after allo-SCT (January 2018), the patient presented with anemia [hemoglobin (Hb) 12.2 g/dl], thrombocytopenia [platelet (PLT): 71 × 109/L], and hyperleukocytosis [white blood cell count (WBC): 20.45 × 109/L] (). MDS with excess blasts type 1 (MDS-EB1) was diagnosed according to the last WHO classification (), with a very high International Prognostic Scoring System (IPSS)-revised score risk. The patient was still on cGVHD treatment with imatinib and tacrolimus. In the meantime, the primitive Ph+ B-ALL was still in complete response (CR) (p190 negative; IF: CD34+, CD19+, CD10+ = 0% of cells).
The cytogenetic analysis suggested the donor cell origin of MDS due to the female karyotype. Moreover, the karyotype was characterized by the presence of a monosomy of chromosome 7 (45 XX, −7, add(18p) [26]; 45 XX, −7q [2]). Conversely, no Ph+ metaphases were found. The chimerism on CD34+ cells (100% donor), together with the fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for sex mismatch (361/361 XX), confirmed the donor cell origin (patient’s sister) of the MDS. At the time of DC-MDS, the patient presented severe lymphopenia (CD4+ : 80/μl; total lymphocytes: 500/μl). In parallel, the patient’s sister has been periodically evaluated, and her peripheral blood counts have always been in range.
A gene panel deep sequencing has been performed at DC-MDS diagnosis to analyze some genes known to be related to myeloid malignancies (). All the promoters and coding sequences of the genes were considered for the analysis. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis revealed NRAS [variant allele frequency (VAF) 51%], RUNX1 (VAF 62.2%), and BCOR (VAF 44.7%) mutations. Notably, the variants detected were not known to be associated with malignancies or other diseases. Considering the VAF of NRAS and the familial history for neoplasia (mother and a sister, not the transplant donor, with colorectal cancer), we investigated the presence of a familiar genetic predisposition for the development of hematologic and solid malignancies. To this purpose, the patient and the donor were enrolled in the NEXT-FamlY clinical trial (NCT03058588) (). This is a national multicentric study focused on the analysis of known and unknown mutations related to familiar predisposition to hematologic malignancies. The germline DNA of both the donor and the recipient resulted negative for the NRAS mutation.
Unfortunately, because of the patient’s conditions compromised by the recurrent infections and GVHD complications, any treatments for the MDS could not be given and the patient died of septic shock a few months after the onset of DC-MDS (September 2018).","

CR_ENG_114,English,"A 72-year-old man was admitted to a local hospital with complaints of general fatigue and body weight loss. A computed tomography (CT) scan of his chest was performed and showed lymphadenopathy in his whole body, including axillar, hilar, mediastinal, and retroperitoneal regions (). The patient was suspected of having malignant lymphoma and underwent excisional biopsy in his right groin. One week after the biopsy, he suddenly presented with a complaint of acute abdominal pain. An emergency contrast enhanced CT scan was performed and revealed a massive retroperitoneal hematoma. Consequently, he was transferred to our hospital for the suspicion of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Upon arrival, he was drowsy, pale, and complained of progressively worsening abdominal pain. His blood pressure was 90/50 mmHg, the pulse rate was 110 beats/min, the hemoglobin was 10.0 g/dL, and the oxygen saturation was 99%. He had no past history of hypertension. A contrast enhanced CT scan was performed repeatedly and revealed a massive retroperitoneal hematoma with active extravasation arising from the infrarenal abdominal aorta coexisting with an extensive retroperitoneal mass surrounding the aorta (). The aorta appeared to be almost of normal caliber, with slight expansion. Radiologic interpretations by a specialist pointed out the density difference between the hematoma and the periaortic soft tissue in the retroperitoneal lesion. As a result, we suspected abdominal aortic rupture caused by invasion by the malignant lymphoma and decided to perform an emergency operation. Considering the risk of tight adhesion between the aorta and the lymphoid tissues, conventional open repair could have been technically difficult. Therefore, we chose to perform endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) as an alternative.
An emergency EVAR was performed under local anesthesia with mild sedation. Initial angiography confirmed an active extravasation arising from the infrarenal abdominal aorta (). An AFX® endoprosthesis (Endologix, Irvine, CA, USA) was placed below the origin of the bilateral renal arteries covering the ruptured aortic segment using standard techniques. In order to avoid type IA endoleak, another extension cuff was placed in the proximal region. Completion angiography showed the endoprosthesis was in a good position and no evidence of endoleak was observed ().
The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful and postoperative CT scan demonstrated complete sealing of the rupture point with no evidence of endoleak (). Five days after the treatment, histological examination of the previous biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), which is one of several subtypes of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Afterwards, the patient was transferred to a specialized hospital for the purpose of receiving chemotherapy for MCL.","

CR_ENG_115,English,"An 18-year-old woman was referred to our hepatobiliary unit for consultation following diagnosis of an enlarging cyst in the tail of the pancreas.
The patient had undergone a partial left lung resection four years earlier as treatment for a left pulmonary echinococcal cyst. During that time, a 3.5-cm cyst was found in the tail of the pancreas on computed tomography (CT) scan (). It was then decided to monitor the pancreatic cyst. Four years later, a routine CT scan was performed; it showed enlargement of the cyst to 4 cm and thickening of the cyst walls. A complete workup, including serology for echinococcus, was performed, yielding positive results. It should be emphasized that the patient was completely asymptomatic during the follow-up period until the three months prior to the abdominal surgery, when she started complaining of vague abdominal pain.
A course of treatment with albendazole 400 mg twice daily and Praziqunantel 20 mg/kg three times daily was given preoperatively for one month, and then a laparoscopic spleen-sparing distal pancreatectomy was performed. The resected tissues were pathologically examined, and the diagnosis of echinococcal cyst with surrounding normal tissue was confirmed.
The postoperative course was eventless, and the patient was discharged on the fifth postoperative day with continued oral albendazole therapy of 400 mg twice daily for another two months. The patient was followed up for four years with unremarkable clinical course.","

CR_ENG_116,English,"A previously healthy 50-year-old Caucasian man was admitted to the L. Spallanzani National Institute for Infectious Diseases in Rome, Italy, with a 1-month history of coughing, fever and weight loss. Chest radiography demonstrated “extensive upper right subclavian and apex left subclavian infiltrates with cavitation” (Figure ). Sputum samples showed numerous acid-fast bacilli and ribonucleic acid amplification-based assay from induced sputum was positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the culture later grew susceptible M. tuberculosis. The purified protein derivative skin test was reactive (10mm). The patient tested negative for human immunodeficiency virus. He began therapy with daily rifampicin (600mg), isoniazid (300mg), pyrazinamide (1500mg) and ethambutol (1200mg). Results of initial laboratory testing including complete blood count, electrolytes and liver and kidney function tests were within normal ranges. On day 42 after admission (still sputum-smear positive), progressive deterioration of renal function was observed. Creatinine levels progressively rose from 38.9μmol/L on admission to 318.2μmol/L (normal, 44.2 to 123.7μmol/L), with a creatinine clearance of 18mL/minute (Figure ) and an increase of urinary sodium (Na+ 285mEq/24hours). Urine volume also progressively increased to reach a state of a true polyuria (8 to10 L of urine per day). Urine examination results were significant, showing 300mg/L of protein with a total excretion of 2500 to 4000mg of protein/day, 200mg/dL of glucose with a total excretion of 1.6 to 2.1g of glucose/day, 50 to 60 white blood cells/high power field and sterile leukocyturia (with sterile urine culture), considered a marker of interstitial nephritis. No eosinophils were present in the urine: specific weight was 1005 to 1007. A blood test indicated a hemoglobin level of 8.70g/dL (normal, 12 to 18g/dL), platelet count of 522 × 103/μL (normal, 80 to 400 103/μL), blood urea nitrogen of 0.29mmol/L (normal, 0.04 to 0.18mmol/L) and serum creatinine of 318.2μmol/L. He began modified antituberculous treatment consisting of isoniazid 300mg once daily, pyrazinamide 1500mg three times weekly, ethambutol 1000mg three times weekly, rifampicin 600mg once daily and moxifloxacin (400mg once daily) but his renal function did not improve. Venous blood gas analysis showed metabolic acidosis (pH 7.30, bicarbonate 19mmol/L, base excess −5) and hypokalemia (K+ 2.8mEq/L). Immunoglobulin testing of the serum showed an increase of immunoglobulin As and immunoglobulin Gs; anti-double stranded deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) antibodies were positive (1:160), antinuclear antibodies were negative and complement factors C3 and C4 levels were normal. Abdominal ultrasonography showed “…kidney increased in volume, with disappearance of the normal cortico-medullary differentiation…”. The patient was treated with 7 to 8L/day of liquids via intravenous infusion; acidosis and hypokalemia were corrected and erythropoietin was administered for anemia. On day 55, his serum creatinine was 358.9μmol/L, blood urea nitrogen was 0.25mmol/L and polyuria persisted. Serum test results for the antidiuretic hormone were within the normal range. Based on previous reports of similar cases, a diagnosis of suspected acute rifampicin-induced renal failure was made. A renal biopsy showed focal segmental glomerulosclerosis associated with acute tubulointerstitial nephritis (Figure a-b). Rifampicin was discontinued and the response was excellent: no further therapy was required (steroids or hemodialysis). Renal function began to improve and 15 days after discontinuing rifampicin, serum creatinine values returned to normal (Figure ). The polyuria gradually regressed and after 20 days, diuresis and venous blood gas analysis returned to normal.","

CR_ENG_117,English,"Patient 1: A 10-year-old boy was the result of the third pregnancy of a 33-year-old, gravida six, para three, Chinese woman. The father was 34 years old. The parents were non-consanguineous and healthy. The pregnancy was uncomplicated and the mother denied any exposure to alcohol, teratogenic agents, irradiation or infectious diseases during the pregnancy. The boy was born at full-term and delivered by spontaneous vaginal delivery. His birthweight was 2,500 g (3rd–10th centile), length was 46 cm (<3rd centile), and head circumference was 30 cm (<3rd centile). His growth continued to be retarded, and his weight was 28.5 kg (<50th centile), length was 101 cm (<3rd centile), and head circumference was 46.5 cm (<3rd centile) at 8 years old. He was noted to have global developmental delay, particularly affecting expressive language. He had never spoken using phrases or ‘word combinations’. His hearing and vision were normal. He had severe intellectual disability (IQ < 25) and response retardation. His cognition, attention and memory were impaired. He was often restless, crying and drooling, was interested in strangers or novel things, and was frequently incontinent. He had dental dysplasia, with aberrant, dust-colored teeth; the maxillary teeth 11 and 21 were reversed, the 21 and 22 dental crowns were incompletely erupted, bilateral deciduous canines were ablated, and the distal ends of both maxillary and mandibular permanent dental crowns were moderately or mildly tilted (Figure ). His motor skills were impaired: his manual dexterity and finger tapping were poor, he was able to pick up chopsticks or a spoon, but could not pick up small items or thread a needle. He was never able to walk or stand without aid, and with aid, was only able to achieve a wobbling walk on tiptoe (Figure ). He was unable to raise or flex his lower limbs freely, and they were ice-cold and insensitive to pain, heat and cold, leading to frequent frostbite and burning (Figure ). Laboratory tests, including white blood cell and platelets counts, bleeding time, sedimentation rate, serum electrolytes and protein, blood glucose, immune electrophoresis, C-reactive protein, C3 complement, autoantibody screening, and antistreptolysin titer revealed no pathologic findings. The concentrations of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were normal, though most sex hormones were lower than the reference values (Table ). The plasma level of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFA) was elevated, with a C24/C22 ratio of 1.342 (reference interval: 0.788–1.090), and C26/C22 ratio of 0.086 (reference interval: 0.018–0.038). Sonography, X-ray examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scan showed no obvious abnormalities. The mother had previously aborted three times and her first child died of liver cancer at the age of 6 years. There was no family history of chromosomal anomaly or similar case, until the birth of a younger brother (patient 2) (Figure ).","

CR_ENG_118,English,"A 34-year-old male with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus (hemoglobin A1c>9.1%) was admitted to the medical intensive care unit with diabetic ketoacidosis, sepsis and melena. The patient had an extensive past medical history which included multiple admissions for diabetic neuropathy, gastroparesis, neurogenic bladder, pyelonephritis, chronic diarrhea due to pancreatic insufficiency, lower extremity amputations for gangrene and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) osteomyelitis. Also, of note was an admission four months prior to this encounter for emphysematous gastritis and esophageal candidiasis.
The patient reported having malaise for one week with congestion, chills and dry cough. His symptoms progressively worsened and he started having fevers with rigors. Subsequently, the patient developed anorexia and stopped taking insulin. Two days prior to admission he also began having multiple episodes of melena each day but had no abdominal distension, hematochezia, vomiting or hematemesis. There was no dyspnea, loss of consciousness, limb weakness or chest pain. The patient presented to the emergency room after he had a syncopal episode and fell at home.
On admission his blood pressure was 84/48 mmHg, heart rate was 100 beats per minute, his temperature was 34.9 °C and oxygen saturation was 100% on room air. The examination was only remarkable for non-specific abdominal tenderness and a clean, well-healed stump from recent amputation. the pH was 6.926 with an anion gap of 19 and beta-hydroxybutyrate levels of 0.7 mmol/L. Treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis was initiated in the emergency room with normal saline infusion and intravenous insulin infusion. The patient was also found to have a white cell count of 28,800/uL with left shift and was started on vancomycin, meropenem with the addition of micafungin given the recent candida infection. Creatinine was elevated from a baseline of 1.7 mg/dL to 1 2mg/dL and fractional excretion of sodium was 1.5%. The patient received one unit packed red-blood-cell transfusion and planned to have upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy as hemoglobin was 6g/dL with positive fecal occult blood testing. Coagulation studies were unremarkable. Rhinovirus PCR testing on nasopharyngeal swabs was positive. Nasal endoscopy performed by ear, nose and throat (ENT) surgeons showed evidence of viral illness but no signs of mucormycosis. Over the next few days, DKA was resolved but the patient continued to have unexplained fevers with negative blood cultures. He also required multiple blood transfusions to maintain acceptable hemoglobin levels. Serum Helicobacter pylori antibodies were negative.
Upper GI endoscopy was completed on the fourth day of admission, revealing a ""black esophagus"" starting at approximately 21 cm from incisors and extending proximally up to the GEJ. Tissue was noted to slough off easily but a normal mucosa could not be visualized. Squamocolumnar junction, diaphragmatic hiatus and GEJ were at 42 cm from the incisors. Additional findings included normal appearance of the bulb and second part of the duodenum as well as a normal gastric mucosa. Endoscopic biopsies of the black distal esophagus showed acute inflammatory exudates with necrotic cells and a nonspecific keratin stain pattern. Cytomegalovirus (CMV) and herpes tests were negative but numerous fungal hyphae were seen on methenamine silver staining.
Gastroenterology team recommended to continue with antimicrobial therapy and high dose proton pump inhibitors and also prescribed ongoing supportive care including good glycemic control, fluid resuscitation and enteral diet as tolerated. Hospital course was further complicated by Staphylococcus hominis bacteremia from the central venous line. However, overall clinical condition continued to improve and the patient was transferred to the general medical floor on the tenth day of admission. The patient was discharged to a skilled nursing facility on the thirteenth day of admission with plans to continue meropenem and micafungin for two more weeks. Follow up upper GI endoscopy showed resolution of necrosis, nevertheless, there was evidence of Los Angeles Grade D esophagitis. The patient had multiple subsequent admissions for chronic diarrhea, gastroparesis and fungal esophagitis.","

CR_ENG_119,English,"A 17-year-old female reported to us with a slowly enlarging mass in her right side of buccal mucosa []. She had first noticed a small swelling six months back. Since then, it had increased markedly in size. The mass was not painful and did not trouble her, except that it had become increasingly noticeable.
Bimanual palpation revealed a firm mobile, 3-cm well-circumscribed mass in the right buccal mucosa region lateral to the upper premolars. The mass could be felt in between the mucosa and skin. The overlying mucosa and skin were of normal colour and texture. Clear saliva was expressed from the right parotid duct. There was no trismus or any associated lymphadenopathy. The clinical features were highly suggestive of a benign lesion.
Ultrasonography showed a well-defined, round; predominantly hypo echoic mass lying underneath the right buccinator muscle. A differential diagnosis of sebaceous cyst or epidermal cyst was suggested. Fine needle aspiration cytology was suggestive of epidermal cyst. All other routine haematological investigations were within normal limits. The tumor was enucleated under general anesthesia []. On gross examination, the encapsulated lesion measured 4 × 2.5 cm, with a whitish, faintly lobulated surface.
Histopathological examination, (×20, HandE stain) showed a neoplasm with an admixture of epithelial and stromal components. Tumor epithelial cells arranged in the form of ducts containing eosinophilic material, islands and sheets []. Outer myoepithelial cells were surrounded by a chondromyxoid stroma, consistent of pleomorphic adenoma.
On magnification (×40, HandE Stain) certain areas showed tumor epithelial cells invading the fibrous capsule []. Cellular details revealed moderate nuclear pleomorphism, loss of chromatin, prominent nucleoli, and moderate mitotic activity. Keratin formation by epithelial cells is also seen []. Due to the presence of atypia and capsular infiltration, the diagnosis of minimal invasive variant of CXPA was made. This rare histopathological diagnosis warranted a therapeutic reconsideration as some of the margins showed infiltration. The patient was recalled after a month and wide local excision done. The second histopathological report was free of tumor cells, and exhibited connective scar tissue. After a 1 year follow-up period, the patient is symptomless and shows no signs of recurrence.","

CR_ENG_124,English,"A 71-year-old male with known atrial fibrillation, diagnosed 2 years previously, visited Seoul St. Mary’s Hospital with symptoms of dysarthria and motor weakness. The patient had a history of lobectomy for treating uncontrolled bronchiectasis in his 30s. The symptoms were eliminated soon after hospitalization without any intervention, and the patient was discharged with the diagnosis of a transient ischemic attack. However, the symptom of dysarthria took place a gain. Based on the possibility of thromboembolism of the cerebral arteries, which can be caused by atrial fibrillation, radiofrequency catheter ablation was performed to treat his atrial fibrillation, but unfortunately his cardiac rhythm did not convert to sinus rhythm. However, in a multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) scan that was taken to verify whether coronary artery disease was present before the ablation procedure, an abnormal communication between the left circumflex artery (LCX) and the bronchial artery was discovered incidentally (). The coronary arteries themselves were revealed to be intact. With the suspicion of a relationship between those symptoms and the coronary-bronchial artery fistula, which could induce myocardial ischemia, a gated 13 N-ammonia positron emission tomography (PET)–computed tomography scan with an adenosine stress test was performed, and showed global left ventricular ischemia in the resting state. Cardiac contractility likewise did not sufficiently increase after adenosine administration (). The flow rates at rest were 0.78 mL/g/min for the left anterior descending artery (LAD), 0.78 mL/g/min for the LCX branch, and 0.66 mL/g/min for the right coronary artery (RCA). The flow rates in the adenosine stress were 1.06 mL/g/min for the LAD, 0.98 mL/g/min for the LCX, and 0.84 mL/g/min for the RCA. The coronary flow reserve was 1.37 mL/g/min, 1. 24 mL/g/min, and 1.27 mL/g/min, respectively, and the average flow reserve was 1.31 mL/g/min, which indicated a generalized decrease of the coronary flow reserve, suggesting the possibility of diffuse microvascular disease (). The flow reserve in the LCX territory was lower than that of the other areas, but the decrease in flow was not especially significant. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed only biatrial enlargement without a wall motion abnormality, and no coronary artery disease was found on a coronary angiogram (CAG). A large fistula from the LCX to both bronchial arteries was present on the C AG (), as previously shown on the MDCT scan.
In order to resolve the patient’s symptoms, closure of the coronary-bronchial artery fistula was scheduled. Since pharmacologic and endovascular management of the patient’s atrial fibrillation had failed before, both the surgical ligation of the fistula and a maze operation via median sternotomy were planned. After median sternotomy followed by pericardiotomy, a tortuous fistulous tract with a diameter of approximately 1.5 mm was found on the roof of the left atrium. After cardiopulmonary bypass with cardioplegia, dissection and clipping of the fistulous tract were performed. A left-side maze operation was also conducted with a cryocatheter, and internal obliteration of the left atrial appendage was performed with a 4-0 prolene suture. Electrocardiography after surgery showed a regular sinus rhythm without recurrence of atrial fibrillation, and a follow-up CAG revealed the successful occlusion of the coronary-bronchial artery fistula (). The patient was discharged with an uneventful postoperative recovery, and no symptoms occurred within the 10-month follow-up period.","

CR_ENG_125,English,"A 16-year-old well built, otherwise healthy boy presented with a 3-month history of a painless swelling over his left neck just below the angle of the mandible (). On palpation there were multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes. Ultrasound scan revealed multiple enlarged cervical lymph nodes of levels I-B, II, III, and IV and largest was at level II with 3.7 cm × 2.0 cm in size (). The cytology report following fine needle aspiration showed numerous eosinophils admixed with lymphocytes and occasional neutrophils. Blood report revealed a marked eosinophilia. Considering these findings, Kimura's disease was suspected with a remote possibility of lymphoma in mind; largest lymph node was removed surgically. Consent was given by the parents.
Histopathologically the lymph node showed completely effaced architecture with multiple granulomas in the background of numerous eosinophils. Faint germinal centres were also noted. There were brown coloured small rounded bodies and hyphae within giant cells (). Periodic Acid Schiff (PAS) and Grocott special stains highlighted the presence of thick walled round and filamentous fungi confined to granulomas but within and outside giant cells (Figures and ). Direct microscopy was done using 10% Potassium Hydroxide (KOH) and we were able to see fungal hyphae. Cultures were obtained on Sabouraud dextrose agar supplemented with chloramphenicol and cyclohexamide (to suppress bacteria and environmental fungi) and incubated at 26°C and 37°C. Moderately expanding, velvety, and olive green coloured colonies with floccose centre were yielded and confirmed the organism as Cladosporium oxysporum and then the final diagnosis was phaeohyphomycosis (Figures and ). Antifungal treatment was started with 200 mg of Itraconazole twice a day. Itra capsules were used as we do not have suspension in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the bioavailability is less compared to suspension. Further it is necessary to state that we do not have facilities to do therapeutic drug level monitoring which is mandatory to do while the patient is on Itra. The problem related is that it is difficult to optimize the dose. Although the swelling has not subsided completely, the patient is currently under follow-up.","

CR_ENG_127,English,"A 34-year-old woman presented to a physician with chief complaints of abdominal pain and fever. The physician suspected acute exacerbation of chronic pancreatitis and referred the patient to the Department of Gastroenterology, Fukushima Medical University Hospital. The patient had a medical history of duodenal atresia treated by emergent surgery 2 days after birth, and annular pancreas and malrotation of the intestine, for which duodenoduodenal anastomosis with Ladd’s procedure was performed. Operative findings revealed no dilatation of the common bile duct. At 9, 23, and 25 years of age, she suffered from repetitive acute pancreatitis and required hospital treatments. Since she had recurrent epigastralgia and back pain, she was diagnosed as having chronic pancreatitis and was prescribed with oral drugs. She was a non-smoker and reported occasional alcohol consumption with no relevant family history.
Laboratory data from blood samples taken at the patient’s first visit to our department exhibited slight elevation of hepatic and biliary tract enzymes (glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase 53 IU/L, glutamic pyruvic transaminase 94 IU/L, alkaline phosphatase 446 IU/L, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase 259 IU/L). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a small round stone, approximately 9.3 mm in diameter, in the common bile duct, and a pancreatic calculus, approximately 14 mm in diameter, in the pancreatic head duct (Fig. ), causing slight dilatation of the distal pancreatic duct. Abdominal ultrasonography showed no dilatation of the intrahepatic bile duct and no thickness of the gallbladder wall. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) revealed annular pancreas around the second portion of the duodenum (Fig. ). Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography (ERCP) was performed to determine the cause of the pancreatitis. ERCP showed a round filling defect caused by the above-mentioned stone and pancreatic calculus (Fig. a). The distal portion of the common bile duct was bended due to the previous surgical procedures for annular pancreas in the neonatal period. Pancreaticobiliary maljunction was suspected because the contrast medium refluxed to the pancreatic duct during cholangiography (Fig. a). The common channel could not be measured exactly, because of the bended distal portion of the common bile duct. The amylase level in bile juice obtained during ERCP was elevated to 2513 U/L. The 3D-cholangiography reconstructed from the CT data (Fig. b) revealed that the pancreatic duct joined the common bile duct at the bend. Preoperative endoscopic ultrasonography was not performed in the present case. As endoscopic sphincterotomy was difficult to perform because of the deformed duodenum due to the previous surgery, only a balloon dilatation of Vater’s papilla was performed. Furthermore, removal of the common bile duct stone could not succeed. Then, we decided to perform surgical treatment. Although intraoperative cholangiography via the cystic duct showed a filling defect in the common bile duct, cholangioscopy via a small incision on the common bile duct showed no stones. Thus, we concluded that that the stone had passed spontaneously. On the basis of the preoperative findings, high levels of amylase in the gallbladder (22,300 U/L), and the presence of a relatively long common channel detected by cholangiography, our patient was diagnosed as having a pancreaticobiliary maljunction without bile duct dilatation. We performed a cholecystectomy in the laparotomy and placed a C-tube in the common bile duct. In histopathological findings, reactive lymph follicle and lymphocytic infiltration were observed around Rokitansky-Aschoff sinus in the gallbladder with no neoplastic lesion in the mucosa.
The postoperative course was uneventful. The bile juice drained from the C-tube showed elevated levels of amylase (32,572 U/L). On postoperative day 13, the C-tube was removed, and the patient was discharged on postoperative day 17. At time of writing, 17 months after surgery, there has been no relapse of pancreatitis. However, medical treatment has been maintained for chronic pancreatitis in this patient.","

CR_ENG_128,English,"A 6-year-old female child presented with an upper lip swelling [] discharging pus from the oral mucosa underlying central part of lip with mild pain exacerbating while eating. The swelling progressed from few millimeters to about 2 cm × 2 cm over 1 year, started discharging thick, pus with white granules. No antecedent external trauma or dental ailments and procedures or self-manipulation were reported. Lesion resolved partially following administration of antibiotics at peripheral health facility. Relapsing symptoms prompted specialist consultation.
The child was a term baby, delivered vaginally without instrumentation during labor. The milestones were average, but Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccine was not administered. The past medical and family histories were non-contributory and other siblings were in good health.
Examination revealed a soft, fluctuant, erythematous, cystic midline upper labial swelling, 2 cm × 2 cm with three openings on the mucosal surface discharging, granular white pus, and a single central sinus opening on the overlying skin discharging serous grey pus []. Physical and systemic examinations were normal, dental hygiene good, and no congenital anomalies apparent. Vitals were normal and X-ray of maxilla ruled out bone involvement. The possibilities of actinomycosis, infected congenital upper lip commissure and tubercular pathology were considered. Mantoux test was negative. The wet mount preparation of pus sample demonstrated granules and gram stained smears showed gram positive cocco-bacilli and polymorphonuclear cells. Aerobic culture of pus on blood agar and Mac Conkey agar were sterile after 24 h of incubation at 37°C. Culture on brain heart infusion blood agar in candle jar grew pale cream, gritty, colonies after 1 week incubation at 37°C []. Smear from culture showed characteristic branching filamentous gram positive beaded rods, which were non-acid fast on Ziehl Neelsen and modified ZN staining. Growth characters, microscopic morphology and standard biochemical reactions revealed A. israelii.[]
Therapy was started with amoxicillin/clavulanic acid and surgical excision done with continuation of antibiotics post-operatively for 4 weeks. We achieved success with a combination treatment. Tissue histopathology revealed a cyst measuring 1.2 cm × 0.6 cm × 0.5 cm grossly, with keratinizing stratified squamous epithelial lining microscopically. Sub-epithelia showed fibro-collagenous tissue, dilated congested blood vessels, hair follicles, skeletal muscle, and sebaceous glands entrapped in the muscle layer with chronic inflammatory cell infiltrate []. Characteristic microcolonies of Actinomyces were not seen. These features suggested an inflamed dermoid cyst.","

CR_ENG_129,English,"A 27-year-old Yemeni woman was referred to the dental hospital in King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, by a general dentist for evaluation and extraction of her third molar (wisdom) tooth. Upon examination, the patient requested an opinion regarding a chronic complaint of a discharge from a wound in her cheek. Examination showed a cutaneous sinus tract with purulent discharge (). Seven years prior to the referral, the patient presented to dermatology clinic with a depression (dimple) in her left cheek, which was then diagnosed as a sebaceous cyst. Based on that diagnosis, the cyst was drained, and the pus was suctioned at several appointments, but no improvement was observed. The depression became more prominent. Six months later, she presented to a plastic surgeon in Yemen, the surgeon performed incision and curettage under local anesthesia and prescribed amoxicillin clavulanate 1g bid for 7 days. Subsequently, swelling occurred and continuous purulent drainage increased. The surgeon performed a culture, and prescribed amoxicillin 500 mg tid for 7 days. A few months later, the continuous discharge remained, therefore, the patient returned to her dermatologist, who performed biopsy, the dermatologist asked the patient to chew gum during the procedure in order to determine if the salivary glands were involved. Saliva was secreted during chewing, and the dermatologist concluded that the parotid gland had been lacerated during the curettage that was previously performed, and that the parotid gland should be removed. The dermatologist referred the patient to a plastic surgeon; however, she was reluctant to undergo the procedure and did not take any action. One year later, the symptoms remained, thus the patient returned to the first plastic surgeon in Yemen who had performed the curettage, with the dermatologist’s suggestion that the parotid gland had been lacerated, and that this served as the source of persistent infection and discharge. The surgeon performed interventional radiology and injected contrast medium into the parotid gland, showing that the gland was intact. The patient then sought a second opinion, this second surgeon performed a series of X-rays, with a similar result. The second surgeon suggested an exploratory surgery to investigate the issue; however, the patient refused. The patient then presented to a third plastic surgeon, who agreed with the other surgeons, that the parotid gland was intact; this third surgeon advised the patient not to undergo any more surgeries to avoid exacerbating the problem. Thus, the patient discontinued treatment until she came to the dental hospital, King Saud University, Riyadh, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. During examination at the hospital, the patient explained that the wound would heal; then (a few days later), pus and blood would accumulate, such that the cheek and face would swell, and the cyst would burst. This pattern was continuously repeated ().
Medical history showed that the patient had no reported medical conditions. She was not taking any medication and reported no allergies. Moreover, the patient did not report any dental pain. Intraoral examination focused on the maxillary left molars, which were near the dimple in the cheek.
Pulp testing, percussion, and periodontal probing were carried out for the tooth, and revealed normal responses. Neighboring and contralateral teeth were also tested and were all within normal. Sinus tract tracing was performed through insertion of a size 30 gutta percha in the fistulae area, and a radiograph was taken (). Cone beam imaging revealed that the mesiobuccal root of tooth #26 penetrated out of the alveolar bone (). Based on the medical history and the results of examination, the patient was diagnosed with odontogenic cutaneous sinus tract secondary to necrotic pulp of tooth #26. Root canal treatment was planned.
During the first visit, access opening was carried out for tooth #26, initial instrumentation and irrigation included an irrigating regimen of sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) (5.25%), followed by saline, and then chlorohexidine (2%). The canals were dried and Ca(OH)2 (Multi-Cal, Pulpdent Corporation, USA) was applied. The patient was examined one week later and showed discontinuation of the external discharge (). There were obvious signs of initial healing of the fistulae. The prior erythematous color of the external scar had reduced. During the second visit, the canals were instrumented with single file, single use WaveOne NiTi files (Dentsply, Maillefer) ISO 25 with taper (8%). The primary WaveOne was used for the buccal canals, while the WaveOne large (file tip ISO 40 with an apical taper of 8%) was used for the palatal canal. The irrigation protocol was repeated, and fresh Ca(OH)2 was applied. The patient returned 6 weeks later for obturation, this was performed using continuous wave vertical obturation with AH26 Plus sealer and 0.04 taper cones for the buccal canals as well as ISO 40 for the palatal canal ().
The final visit was after 7 weeks; examination showed that substantial healing occurred, and the adjacent tooth was finalized (). Scar subcision and Fraxel laser skin resurfacing were used to improve the texture and tone of the skin ().","

CR_ENG_131,English,"A 45-year-old woman presented with a 3-month history of intermittent abdominal cramping and hematochezia. Initially, she noticed occasional bright red blood per rectum when wiping but was otherwise asymptomatic. She had no associated abdominal pain, lightheadedness, chest pain, or shortness of breath. The episodes of rectal bleeding became more frequent and were associated with diffuse abdominal pain, at which point she decided to seek medical attention. Her pertinent medical history includes hemodialysis-dependent end-stage renal disease, type 2 diabetes mellitus, ischemic cardiomyopathy, peripheral vascular disease, and endometrial carcinoma that was treated with radiation and surgical resection 22 years previously.
Her first hospitalization was at an outside institution for sepsis secondary to Clostridium difficile colitis. She was found to be anemic and required transfusion of red blood cells. Her abdominal pain and rectal bleeding improved, and she was discharged on oral vancomycin. One month later, she again had repeated episodes of rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. There had been no changes to her medications. She was not on anticoagulation and had not been taking any anti-inflammatory medications other than low-dose aspirin. She presented to our tertiary-care hospital for further evaluation.
Upon presentation at our institution, she had normal vital signs with a temperature of 36.0°C, heart rate of 80 b.p.m., blood pressure of 110/50 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 12 breaths/min, and oxygen saturation of 100% on 2 liters by nasal cannula. There was no evidence of active gastrointestinal bleeding. She appeared comfortable with normal cardiac and lung exam. Her abdominal exam was significant for mild suprapubic tenderness, otherwise was soft without any guarding, rigidity, or rebound tenderness. Laboratory studies were significant for hemoglobin of 8.0 g/dl (range 11.7–15.0) and hematocrit of 25% (range 35–44). Serum lactic acid level was normal. A contrast CT scan of the abdomen showed mesenteric edema without significant colonic thickening. Her medication list was extensive and included baby aspirin, simvastatin, insulin glargine, gabapentin, cholestyramine 4,000 mg twice daily, and sevelamer 3,200 mg with meals.
She was treated with intravenous fluids and transfusion of one or two units of blood, as needed, with appropriate response. On hemodialysis days, she was noted to have transient, asymptomatic episodes of hypotension with systolic blood pressure ranging from 70 to 80 mm Hg, raising suspicion for ischemic colitis, although she had bloody bowel movements on nondialysis days as well.
Due to ongoing rectal bleeding, she underwent colonoscopy which showed partially healing linear ulcerations at the flexures, transverse and sigmoid colon, suggestive of ischemic colitis (fig. ). There was also a stricture approximately 30 cm from the anal verge that could only be traversed with a pediatric upper scope, revealing inflamed and friable mucosa with neovascularization, consistent with radiation colitis. The working diagnosis was believed to be a combination of ischemic and radiation colitis. Unfortunately, her symptoms persisted despite supportive care.
Two days later, the pathology report for her biopsies returned indicating acute inflammation, ulceration, and granulation tissue associated with fragments of crystal material (fig. , fig. ). After careful review of the patient's medication list and a thorough literature search, both sevelamer and cholestyramine were identified as medications that were associated with the formation of crystal fragments. Both of these medications were immediately discontinued and 2 days later her hematochezia resolved and her hemoglobin level stabilized. She was subsequently discharged to a rehabilitation facility with plans for a repeat colonoscopy in 8 weeks to document mucosal healing; however, the patient died of complications from renal failure 3 weeks prior to the scheduled procedure. No autopsy was performed.","

CR_ENG_132,English,"A 57-year-old Caucasian man presented for a total body skin check. Multiple benign pigmented lesions were observed. However, examination of his hands revealed an absence of all fingernails and thumbnails; in contrast, his toenails were intact and normal in appearance (Figure ). Pterygium, extending from the proximal nail fold to the nail bed, was also observed on multiple digits of his hands (Figure ).
Additional history revealed that he entered the Navy 40 years ago. For three years, his work involved using methyl ethyl ketone to strip off adhesives, grease, and paint from planes and helmets. His digits would regularly be exposed to methyl ethyl ketone for 30 to 60 minutes several days per week approximately every other month.

CR_ENG_133,English,"A 17-year-old female lung transplant recipient for cystic fibrosis underwent bronchoscopy to assess response to both intravenous (IV) pulse methylprednisolone for acute A2B0 allograft rejection diagnosed 2 weeks earlier and ongoing IV ganciclovir and foscarnet for cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection. Upon inspection of the left main bronchus, there were substantial changes as compared to the bronchoscopy 2 weeks before, showing narrowing of the airway lumen and mucosal edema with friability to the point of not being able to advance the bronchoscope into either the left upper or lower lobe segments. Subsequently, the right allograft was evaluated with bronchoalveolar lavage and transbronchial biopsies of both right middle and lower lobes being performed without difficulty. The patient tolerated the procedure well including biopsies until 5 min after withdrawing the bronchoscope when she dropped her oxyhemoglobin saturation (SaO2) to 86% despite mechanical ventilation. Chest radiograph revealed left lung collapse [], so the bronchoscope was immediately re-inserted with the discovery of complete occlusion or vanishing of the left main bronchus []. The bronchoscope was not able to be advanced through this tissue occluding the airway, so alligator forceps were used to try to perforate it. After numerous attempts, eventually a small opening [] was obtained. However, her respiratory status declined due to severe hypoxic respiratory failure with no improvement with inhaled nitric oxide and trial of high-frequency oscillatory ventilation. She was therefore placed on VV ECMO with immediate normalization of SaO2. While on VV ECMO, balloon dilatation of the left main bronchus was successfully performed through the small opening attained earlier. A CRE™ balloon was used to dilate the area from 4 mm initially to 6 mm, and then to 8 mm diameter. The balloon was passed through a 6.4 mm dia Olympus bronchoscope. She was removed from ECMO the following day and extubated 3 days later. The remaining part of her hospital course was unremarkable with her being discharged 2 weeks later.","

Computed tomography angiography analysis revealed the occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery (MCA) main segment (). As the exact onset of symptoms was unknown, the neurologist decided to withhold IV thrombolysis and send the patient directly to mechanical thrombectomy.
The ER staff spotted a large ST elevation on the monitor of the patient waiting for transfer to the angiography suite. While the patient could not signal chest pain, being completely mute due to aphasia, a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) confirmed the extensive anterior ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) pattern ().
The neurointerventional service that day was provided by an accredited interventional cardiologist with completed neurointerventional fellowship training, thus a consensual decision was taken by the cardiology and neurology teams to request the execution of the necessary endovascular interventions within a single procedure.
The patient was transferred to the catheterization laboratory with anaesthesia backup. The right femoral artery was cannulated with an oversized, 9-Fr sheath to allow continuous invasive blood pressure monitoring. As a first step, a coronarography was performed to rule out a suspected Takotsubo syndrome caused by a potential stroke-induced spasm. While no sign of coronary spasm was seen, a sub-occlusive thrombotic lesion was documented at the origin of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery (). Taken the slow but persistent coronary flow, the patient’s stable haemodynamic condition, and the haemorrhagic risk associated with a stroke intervention under dual antiplatelet therapy into account, coronary stenting was temporarily withheld, and 500 mg of IV aspirin was administered only ().
To save time, the fastest cerebral recanalization technique, aspiration thrombectomy was performed in the left MCA using a dedicated 6-Fr aspiration catheter (Sofia Plus, Microvention Terumo Inc., Aliso Viejo, CA, USA). Complete flow restoration was achieved with a single pass, and the patient’s right hemiplegia promptly improved.
As no sign of complication was detected on control angiography (), the operator decided to continue with the coronary revascularization after the administration of 7500 IU Na-heparin. Two 14″ guidewires were advanced into the LAD and circumflex (CX) coronaries, pre-dilatation of the lesion was performed, and an everolimus-eluting stent (Resolute Integrity, Medtronic Inc., Dublin, Ireland) was implanted in the left main (LM)-LAD continuum. The LM portion of the stent was post-dilated by a non-compliant balloon at 20 ATM (). Although the origin of the CX was covered with struts, the flow was patent, and no further post-dilatation was performed to avoid the need for bifurcation stenting. The puncture site was closed by a closure device. As soon as the post-operative control CT ruled out any complication (), the patient was loaded with 600 mg of clopidogrel. Control ECG in the cardiac care unit showed complete ST resolution ().
Neurological examination on the following day revealed only mild clumsiness of the right hand with a very mild word-finding difficulty (NIHSS 2 points). Laboratory analysis documented a peak high-sensitivity troponin T level of 595 pg/mL. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging performed on the 12th day following the interventions showed preserved ejection fraction (EF 55%) with only mild septal hypokinesia. Surprisingly, no late enhancement and no cardiac source of emboli were documented (). Prolonged rhythm monitoring using 72-h Holter ECG did not detect atrial fibrillation. Patient was scheduled for haematology examination as the next step of her work up. She remained independent upon her discharge to rehabilitation (modified Rankin Scale: 1).","

CR_ENG_136,English,"Fifty-four year old male
The chief complaint of the patient included breathing difficulty and coughing during exercise that developed 2 months previously.
Breathing difficulty and coughing aggravated further during mountain hiking. A pulmonary disease was suspected from the findings of chest radiographs. The patient was hospitalized to obtain an accurate diagnosis and for treatment.
On a special health examination performed 5 months before admission, no unusual findings were observed on the plain chest radiography. The patient had no ophthalmologic diseases, but complained of eye dryness for several months. He frequently used artificial tears because of the eye dryness.
The patient had a history of smoking 20 cigarettes a day for 20 years and then 10 cigarettes a day for 10 years; however, he quit smoking 3 months previously. He has a history of consuming five bottles (350 mL) of soju (approximately 18 % alcohol by volume) per week. No significant family history of autoimmune diseases was noted.
On admission, the patient’s vital signs were stable with blood pressure of 140/80 mmHg, pulse rate of 86 beats/min, respiratory rate of 20 breaths/min and body temperature of 37.0 °C. Although the patient showed an acute ill-looking appearance, his consciousness was clear, cardiac sound regular, and no heart murmur was heard. Fine inspiratory crackles were heard at both lower lung fields. Finger clubbing was not observed, but fingers were swollen and skin was thickened. The findings in the abdomen, extremities, and neurological examination were normal.
In a plain chest radiograph obtained on admission, ground glass opacities (GGOs) were observed at the lower part of both lungs (Fig. ). In a chest computed tomography image, reticulation and GGOs were observed in both lungs, leading to the diagnosis of interstitial lung disease (Fig. ).
In arterial blood gas analysis performed before hospitalization, pH was 7.4; PaCO2, 38 mmHg; PaO2, 94.2 mmHg; and oxygen saturation, 97.3 %. In a peripheral blood test, the leukocyte count was 8,300/μL; hemoglobin, 5.2 g/dL; and platelet count, 436,000/μL. In a lung function test, findings of restrictive lung function disorder were obtained with forced vital capacity (FVC) 2.62 L (67 % of the predicted value), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) 2.31 L (80 % of the predicted value), the ratio of FEV1/FVC 88 %, forced expiratory flow 25–75 % 4.76 L/sec (154 % of the predicted value), and peak expiratory flow rate 8.16 L/sec (110 % of the predicted value).
The results of bronchoscopy and a lung lavage test revealed chronic inflammation with fibrosis. The results of lung biopsy were consistent with usual interstitial pneumonitis. Breathing difficulty was alleviated with systemic steroid therapy. During admission, the patient complained of dry mouth and difficulty of swallowing dry food without liquid. Immune serologic tests were performed under suspicion of autoimmune disease. The results of serologic tests were as follows; positive for antinuclear antibody (1:2560), negative for rheumatoid factor, positive for anti-SSA (Ro) antibody, negative for anti-SSB (La) antibody and positive for anti-Scl 70 antibody. The anti-ds DNA level was 7.64 IU/mL (reference level, <7.0 IU/mL). The secretory function of the salivary gland was considered to be decreased. In a salivary gland scan, the uptake increases in the parotid gland and submandibular gland were relatively normal; however, the ejection fraction of the salivary gland after stimulation decreased by more than the moderate level. Although the results of Schirmer’s test did not satisfy the diagnostic criteria for Sjögren’s syndrome, with the right eye showing a result of 12 mm in 5 min and the left eye showing a result of 7 mm in 5 min, they were found to be lower than the normal range. Other diseases such as hepatitis C, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, lymphoma and sarcoidosis were excluded by medical history and the results of relevant laboratory tests. Clinical findings including ocular symptom of dry eyes, oral symptom of difficulty in swallowing dry food without liquid, oral sign of abnormal salivary scintigraphy and positive autoantibody of anti-SSA (Ro) antibody were compatible with diagnostic criteria for Sjögren’s syndrome (Table ) []. In addition, there were some features of systemic sclerosis (puffy fingers, interstitial lung disease and positive for systemic sclerosis related autoantibody [anti-Scl 70]) according to the revised classification criteria of systemic sclerosis (Table ) []. The patient has been followed for the overlap syndrome with Sjögren’s syndrome and systemic sclerosis.
The patient had worked for 25 years as a worker in the large-scale rolling department of a steel-manufacturing company. He was in charge of maintenance and repairs for the roughing mill and intermediate mill. His major tasks were the management of oils, roll exchange of the rolling mill for different sizes and stand-seating manufacture. Rolling is a plastic process in which the cross-sectional thickness of a material is reduced by successively pressing while passing it between two rollers. A roughing mill is the first process where slabs coming out of the furnace are rolled, and this produces dust containing silica. Hot rolling is a rolling process performed at a temperature of between 1100 °C and 1200 °C. A large amount of fumes develops at that high temperature. Generally, the hot rolling process is a wet process. As it progresses, oxidized film on the surface of the rolled material is removed and water is jet-sprayed to prevent the high generation of fumes. The final product is a scroll-shaped intermediate processed product called a coil, after which additional processing is performed in the cold rolling process. The large-scale milling process in which he was involved is a series of operations comprising the furnace, roughing mill, intermediate mill, finishing mill and cutting. The roll was being exchanged for different sizes more than once a day, depending on the work volume. To meet the production standards when changing the roll, the process of resting the new roll on a stand, dissembling the existing roll and performing the exchange was mainly performed near the rolling mill owing to the nature of the work. According to the report of working environment measurement, noise, dust, toxic metals and heat were identified as occupational hazards. In general, workers in the milling process take 30-min rest after 30-min working because of the high-heated working condition. The patient has worked on the three-shift system. The total ventilation system was applied in the plant, and the patient has regularly used personal protective equipment including mask and ear plugs.
It was verified that standard steel products produced by a series of hot rolling processes contain a maximum of 0.4 % silicon []. However, the concentration of free silica in the air was not measured directly. Instead, type 2 dust, which contains silicon dioxide up to 30 %, was measured as mineral dust. According to the report of working environment measurement in 2008, the concentration of type 2 dust was 1.444 mg/m3 and 0.417 mg/m3 in the roughing and intermediate mills, respectively (Table ). Potential toxic substances other than silica were found in the milling process such as nickel, chromium and manganese, but the ambient concentration was very low or not detectable. For example, the highest concentration of nickel and manganese were measured at the roughing mill site, which were 0.0026 mg/m3 and 0.0051 mg/m3, respectively (Table ).","

CR_ENG_139,English,"We describe here the case of a 69-year-old female with a past medical history notable for a partially resected nonsecreting pituitary macroadenoma. She had presented 20 years prior with acute onset bitemporal hemianopsia and, upon CT scan, was shown to have a nonsecreting pituitary adenoma in contact with the optic chiasm. She underwent a partial transsphenoidal resection of the adenoma in 1993 as the sphenoidal sinus was described as very narrow, and thus, only 60% of the tumour was resected. However, there was no residual interaction with the optic chiasm. The patient was advised that another surgery may be necessary in the future and left the hospital with no residual symptoms. Her past medical history also includes morbid obesity (BMI 58), obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS) treated with CPAP since 2004, insulin-dependent type 2 Diabetes, glaucoma, and asthma.
The patient was readmitted for a subsequent surgery after having developed a recurrence of visual symptoms. The patient underwent a transsphenoidal surgery without complication. No suspicion of CSF leak was described in the operative protocol. Her postoperative period was complicated by a left ophthalmic artery occlusion and an acute subarachnoid hemorrhage, which are both documented complications after transsphenoidal surgery. [] The patient left the hospital three weeks postoperatively for rehabilitation before returning home.
The patient demonstrated good progress during rehabilitation. Nasal CPAP was reintroduced (autoset with a range of 5-12 cm H2O) around five weeks postoperatively. Soon thereafter, she rapidly developed fever up to 39C, decreased level of consciousness, and nuchal rigidity, and was subsequently transferred back to our institution. Brain CT scan demonstrated hydrocephalus and pneumocephalus as shown in Figures and . Sphenoidoscopy demonstrated left CSF fistula. A lumbar puncture revealed a cerebrospinal fluid with elevated leukocytes, glucose level of 6.8, and lactic acid of 6.8. Cultures did not demonstrate any pathogen. A diagnosis of culture-negative meningitis secondary to reopening of the surgical site by CPAP was postulated. The patient was treated with broad spectrum antibiotics, an external ventricular drain was installed, and the patient was monitored until her discharge.","

CR_ENG_141,English,"A 67-year-old man presented with lower urinary tract symptoms and right flank pain for three months. The serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) and free PSA (fPSA) values were 13.07 ng/mL and 0.22 ng/mL, respectively. Digital rectal examination revealed a harder prostate gland. Computed tomography urography (CTU) demonstrated right hydronephrosis secondary to thickening of the distal ureter (), mass of the right lateral bladder wall, and benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). Enhanced CT scan was conducted subsequently and showed thickening of distal ureter on the right side, with about 6 cm length.
Transrectal ultrasound guided biopsy was conducted firstly and pathological reports showed prostate adenocarcinoma with Gleason score 4 + 5 = 9. Ureteroscopy was performed shortly after mass of bladder was excised and pathologic examination revealed metastases of prostate adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue showed that prostate specific antigens (PSA), P504s and Ki67, were positive, while cytokeratin 7 (CK7), CK20, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), P53, Syn, and Cga were negative. In ureteroscopy, we also found that the mucosa between space occupying focus of bladder and ureteral orifice was normal and free from tumor deposits. However, the ureteroscopy was hard to pass the stricture of the right distal ureter, so it is impossible to obtain the biopsy result. No skeletal or lung metastasis was detected by skeletal scintigraphy and chest radiography, respectively.
Three days' morning urine was collected for cytological examination, one of which revealed urothelial carcinoma. Combining with imaging findings and pathologic report of the bladder masses, a distal ureteral transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) was thought to be most likely. Considering its higher degree of malignancy, nephroureterectomy was recommended. Before removal of the kidney, intraoperative frozen section was submitted and the histology result was in accordance with urine cytology, revealing ureteral TCC. Finally, nephroureterectomy was carried out. To our surprise, immunohistochemical staining of the tumor tissue revealed that the PSA and P504s+ were positive (showed in ), all of which indicated that the urothelial carcinoma of the ureter turned out to be metastasis of prostate cancer.
The patient reported a significant improvement of lower urinary tract symptoms after nephroureterectomy. The patient was reassessed in two weeks after surgery. His creatinine was slightly increased to 116.4 μmol/L (normal range: 59–104 μmol/L), while the urea nitrogen remained normal. He was treated with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone analogue injection (goserelin Acetate SR Depot) and testosterone and PSA level were monitored every two months. The testosterone was maintained at approximately 0.4 nmol/L after eight months' follow-up. The PSA level decreased to 0.045 ng/mL six months later and then increased at eight months (0.16 ng/mL). Four months later, three skeletal metastases were found in skeletal scintigraphy and pelvic magnetic resonance.","

CR_ENG_142,English,"The patient in this case was a 40-year-old man with a history of uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and a hemoglobin A1c of 10.7. The patient had a history of uncontrolled blood sugar and diabetic ketoacidosis. The patient also had a history of using illicit drugs in previous years. Nevertheless, upon admission, he was found to be on daily sublingual buprenorphine. The patient was also a smoker, averaging one pack of cigarettes per day. Finally, it was noted that the patient had very poor dentation, and multiple caries were noted upon physical oral exam.
The patient was initially brought to hospital by Emergency Medical Services (EMS).
The patient's family found him to be lethargic with a distinct fruity smell from his mouth. Two weeks prior to admission, the patient was complaining of multiple symptoms, including increased leg swelling, shortness of breath, fatigue, nausea, vomiting, and poor appetite. There was no report of fever, chills, chest pain, or cough. He had history of penicillin allergy causing skin rash. The patient's history was obtained from the patient's mother.
The patient's vital signs on admission were temperature, 98.5 Fahrenheit (F); blood pressure, 98/64 millimeter of mercury (mm Hg); pulse, 101 beats per minute; and respiratory rate, 24 per minute. Cardiac exam showed tachycardia with III/VI systolic murmur. Lungs auscultation showed crackles at the bases, but no wheezing. Lower extremities had +2 pitting edema. Oral cavity showed very poor dentition, multiple caries, and necrotic teeth.
Other patient labs showed elevated blood sugar, up to 1000 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl); white blood cell count, 29 thousand per cubic milliliter (K/µL); creatinine, 2.20 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl); ALT, 15 units per liter (U/L); sodium, 141 millimoles per liter (mmol/L); and procalcitonin, 3.59 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL). Troponin was less than 0.015 ng/mL. Blood gases showed pH, 6.9; lactic acid, 5.3 mmol/L; and blood glucose, 1060 mg/dl; urine drug screen was negative, and urine analysis showed no leukocytes.
A computed tomography (CT) of brain was performed and was negative for any acute finding.
However, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain without contrast showed small acute cortical infarct in the left cerebellar hemisphere with two another tiny acute embolic infarcts in the right parietal and occipital lobes ().
Chest X-ray showed bilateral lung congestion. Two sets of blood culture were obtained and sent to microbiology laboratory. He was started on broad-spectrum intravenous (IV) antibiotic vancomycin and cefepime. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiogram study was technically difficult and suboptimal in quality; thus, transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) was performed, and it showed multiple echodensities compatible with vegetations, associated with moderate aortic valve insufficiency, and mild aortic stenosis. The largest vegetation measures 1.6 × 0.9 cm (Figures and ).The estimated left ventricular ejection fraction was approximately 30%.
Subsequently, the patient's blood cultures turned positive for Gram-positive rods, which were identified as Lactobacillus rhamnosus. Susceptibility tests were requested from microbiology laboratory, and it was manually performed using the broth dilution minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method. The results showed sensitivity to ampicillin with MIC equal to 1 microgram per milliliter (mg/ml), clindamycin with MIC equal to or less than 0.06 (mg/ml), erythromycin with MIC equal to or less than 0.06 (mg/ml), with penicillin MIC equal to 0.5 (mg/ml) and resistant to vancomycin with MIC higher than 32 (mg/ml). Due to the patient's history of penicillin allergy, the antibiotics were adjusted to IV meropenem. After 96 hours from admission, repeated blood culture became sterilized. Oral surgery was consulted, and the patient underwent full teeth extraction. Nevertheless, the identified source of the bacteremia was from the oral cavity. Due to the size of the vegetation and signs of congestive heart failure, the patient was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgeon and underwent surgery with aortic valve replacement using 23 mm Mosaic porcine tissue valve. Notes from surgery showed a large vegetation on the fused right and left coronary cusp, almost filling the aortic valve and also another vegetation on the noncoronary cusp. Tissue valve culture results showed the same organism isolated from the blood upon arrival to the hospital. Pathology of the excided aortic valve reported myxoid degeneration, focal acute inflammation with fibrinous exudate containing bacterial colonies.
The patient clinically responded well to antibiotic treatment and was discharged home to complete six weeks of IV meropenem. A follow-up and two-dimensional echocardiogram was scheduled after 3 months of end therapy, and it showed improvement in the ejection fraction up to 70%, and the bioprosthetic aortic valve was functioning normally with no signs of regurgitation.","

CR_ENG_145,English,"A 20-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department with a severe anxiety attack lasting 7 days. She reported chest and throat tightness, vomiting and dry retching, and crepitus on palpation of her neck. An undiagnosed anxiety disorder was her only medical history of note. She reported similar crepitus in her neck following an anxiety attack some months previously, which resolved.
On initial assessment, pneumoderma was palpable on the anterior chest wall and neck. Blood tests revealed a haemoglobin level of 176 g/L (normal range 110–150 g/L) and white blood cell count of 17.71 × 109/L (normal range 3.5–11 × 109/L). Serum urea and creatinine were mildly raised from her baseline. The C-reactive protein level was 7 mg/L (normal range < 5 mg/L). These results were largely explained by dehydration secondary to prolonged vomiting. A chest radiograph () revealed extensive surgical emphysema and pneumomediastinum.
An enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the neck and chest is shown in . This demonstrated extensive pneumomediastinum (A), as well as subcutaneous emphysema extending from the chest wall (B) into the soft tissues of the neck (C and D). Air was noted to have leaked into the spinal canal. Imaging did not reveal a tracheal tear or airway injury.
Nasendoscopy to the level of the vocal cords did not reveal an obvious source of air leak. Neither an enhanced CT thorax and abdomen following oral gastrograffin contrast, nor a water-soluble contrast swallow examination () showed any evidence of contrast leak or identify a source of perforation.
The patient was commenced on antibiotics, intravenous fluids and kept nil by mouth. During the initial observation period, a clinical diagnosis of mediastinitis was made due to worsening chest pain, fevers and rising inflammatory markers. Broad spectrum antibiotics were continued.

CR_ENG_146,English,"A 35-year-old female presented with a ponto-mesencephalic intracerebral hemorrhage due to a ruptured arteriovenous malformation (AVM). After an initial partial recovery (with complete return of her level of consciousness), she went to a rehabilitation center where, 5 months later, she experienced a second intraparenchymal hemorrhage in the pons and midbrain, extending to the fourth ventricle, complicated by seizures and hydrocephalus. Once more, she regained consciousness following this second hemorrhage and underwent a surgical resection of her AVM eighteen days after the second ictus. During the operation, she suffered from a hemorrhage in the fourth ventricle and in the pontine surgical cavity. Post-operatively, she developed obstructive hydrocephalus which was treated with extraventricular drainage. However, she failed to regain normal consciousness during the weeks that followed. She was recruited to the study 53 days post-operation, when she was in MCS (CRS-R = 12, ). This patient was excluded from the anesthetic protocol as she was persistently febrile. Two weeks after data collection, she began obeying commands with her right foot and left arm. Upon discharge, 5 months and 23 days after data collection, the patient was behaviorally responsive and communicative (CRS-R = 23).
Motif analysis. The participant’s alpha motifs had similar topographic patterns to conscious controls (). As they were close to emergence (CRS-R = 12), this was expected and may suggest that their brain network had the capacity to sustain consciousness. Motif 1 was concentrated in central brain regions ( 0.530); motif 7 was spread across peripheral electrodes ( 0.476). Motifs in the theta () and delta bands () were also similar to conscious controls.
Hub analysis. Alpha network hubs were dissimilar to conscious controls (0.157) (), as were hubs in the theta () and delta bands ().
Power analysis. At baseline, alpha power topography did not resemble the distribution for conscious controls (0.281) (). Neither did theta () or delta () power topography.
Graph theoretical network properties. At baseline, in the alpha band, global efficiency was within the range of conscious controls, while clustering coefficient, binary small-worldness, and modularity were all elevated relative to conscious controls (, red circles). Graph theoretical properties in the theta (, red circles) and delta band (, red circles) were either lower than or within the range of conscious controls.
Relative power analysis. Relative power in the delta band was within the range of conscious controls, while relative theta power was higher and relative alpha power was lower than in conscious controls (, red circles).","

CR_ENG_147,English,"A 17-day-old African-American girl was admitted for management of failure to thrive and general malaise. The initial workup was guided, in part, by an abnormal newborn hemoglobin electrophoresis screen consistent with SCD. Repeat electrophoresis confirmed a diagnosis of S-βthal. In addition to the patient’s hematologic workup, the patient was found to have a severely low fecal elastase level (<50μg elastase/g stool) consistent with pancreatic insufficiency. Subsequent sweat testing was performed and was positive on two occasions (73 and 72mmol/L with first test; 88 and 103mmol/L with second test) confirming a diagnosis of CF. CF genotyping results were positive for one intronic mutation for C.53+2 T>C; a second mutation was not identified.
This patient, who is now 4 years of age, has required 15 hospitalizations (most during the first 2 years of life) to manage complications of both CF and S-βthal. In general, the majority of hospitalizations were for presumed CF pulmonary exacerbations or weight loss. At 2 years of age, the patient began to develop vaso-occlusive events (VOE) including multiple bouts of pain crises and hepatic sequestration contributing to prolonged hospital stays for CF pulmonary exacerbations. Pain crises involving the chest, back, and abdomen limited both airway clearance and nutritional support with enteral feedings. Furthermore, the patient faced acute respiratory decline during VOE with hypoxia, fever, wheezing, and a new pulmonary infiltrate on chest radiograph consistent with ACS. The underlying etiology of ACS development was unclear although it was attributed to complications of CF, S-βthal, or both. Along with computed tomography imaging of the chest (mild bronchiectasis with bibasilar opacities consistent with atelectasis) and flexible bronchoscopy (normal airway anatomy with diffuse, viscous white secretions with 2,704 cells/mm3 and 51% neutrophils), IPFT measures were obtained to better define respiratory physiology and guide a treatment plan.
Infant lung function testing was performed using the RVRTC technique which elevates the lung volume of infants to near total lung capacity prior to performing a rapid thoracic compression maneuver. These forced expiratory flows from raised lung volumes were obtained after sedation with chloral hydrate according to American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society guidelines and approximate adult-type lung function maneuvers []. Post-bronchodilator results were not obtained due to lack of sedative effects near the end of testing. IPFT data (Figure A) demonstrate moderate-to-severe lower airways obstruction, moderate air trapping, and no evidence of restrictive lung disease.
The IPFT data prompted initiation of inhaled deoxyribonuclease (DNase) in an effort to reduce any distal neutrophilic mucus impaction contributing to air trapping. In addition, due to the combination of frequent VOE, ACS, and new evidence of lower airways obstruction, hydroxyurea was started to attempt to theoretically minimize progression of SCLD []. Although hydroxyurea is predominantly utilized in patients with more severe forms of SCD, clinical response has been shown in patients with S-βthal[]. Chronic transfusion therapy was considered but is not optimal given the risks of iron overload, autoantibody and alloantibody formation, and human leukocyte antigen sensitization that could complicate future stem cell and/or lung transplantation. Hospitalization frequency has subsequently improved with a reduction from 3.5 admissions/year to 0.5 admission/year following IPFT and therapeutic interventions. Spirometry data obtained at 4 years of age is included for comparison in Figure B. Although expiratory time is short, flow-volume loops reflect evidence of effort-independent flow limitation and suggest continued moderate lower airways obstruction with significant response to bronchodilator. Inhaled budesonide was initiated following spirometry secondary to the findings of bronchodilator responsiveness.","

CR_ENG_151,English,"A 60-year-old male with a history of C6 American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) A quadriplegia 41 years prior, presented with the new complaint of episodes of spiking hypertension, diaphoresis, and dizziness. This had occurred on a daily basis for six months and was brought on by any change in trunk position. His systolic blood pressure was noted to rise up to 200 mmHg during these episodes. While the patient had no remaining sensory or motor function below the C6 level and no remaining voluntary bowel or bladder function, the patient reported that due to the high frequency of these episodes he had completely lost any remaining quality of life.
CT of the lumbar spine revealed an enlarged L1-2 disc space with over 50% erosion of the adjacent endplates, along with vacuum disc. Severe spinal canal and neural foraminal narrowing was also seen with multiple large bridging osteophytes. The rest of the thoracolumbar spine had the appearance of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis and was fused. An MRI of the lumbar spine revealed edema of the L1-2 endplates as well as some fluid in the disc space, as shown in Figures -.
A needle aspiration of the L1-2 disc space was performed to rule out infection and these results were negative. As extensive workup ruled out other causes, it was determined that the patient’s clinical picture and imaging findings were most consistent with autonomic dysreflexia secondary to Charcot’s arthropathy of the lumbar spine.
The patient underwent posterior instrumentation from T8 to L5 with four-rod fixation and partial L1 and L2 corpectomy with extracavitary approach. The patient was positioned prone and the incision was made midline from T8 down to the S1 level. Extension to S1 was originally planned, but, while performing the dissection, it was noted that, in order to expose S1, the incision would need to be extended through unhealthy areas of the skin near the anal opening. Due to concern for difficult wound healing, the decision was made to limit instrumentation to the L5 level. A four-rod construct was utilized, which would involve using medial as well as lateral entry points for the pedicle screws with the goal of connecting two interlinked rods on each side. As per our surgical planning, we proceeded with pedicle screw instrumentation. Lateral and medial entry points for pedicle screws were alternated. The lateral entry point was at the junction of the lateral border of the superior facet along the line bisecting the transverse process. The medial entry point for the pedicle screw was along the medial border of the superior facet along the line bisecting the transverse process. Once pedicle screws were placed and confirmed with fluoroscopy, the right lateral and then medial titanium rods were contoured, placed, and fixed using set screws.
An extracavitary approach was then performed and partial corpectomy at L1-2 was performed from the left side. Transverse processes of L1 and L2 were exposed and then removed. Further medial dissection was performed to expose the exiting nerve root. The lateral portion of the L1-2 facet was removed using a drill. Once the L1 root was isolated, it was tied off and transected. Following this, further removal of the L1-2 facet and lateral part of the lamina was done to expose the dura. Ligamentum flavum was removed. Once the dura was exposed, it was retracted medially. This allowed posterolateral extracavitary access to the L1-2 disc space and vertebral bodies.
We then entered the area of pathology at L1-2. There was a large void in the L1-2 disc space. The endplates were decorticated and samples were sent for pathology; these were negative for tumor or infection. An expandable titanium cage was then placed and filled with bone morphogenetic protein. Following this, the pedicle screws on the left side were connected with the medial and lateral rods which were adequately sized and contoured. These rods were again interlinked with a rod-to-rod connector. Posterolateral fusion was done across L1-2 on the right side with cancellous bone allograft and bone morphogenetic protein. The reduction and stabilization of the spine was confirmed through posterior x-rays and the postoperative CT, as shown in Figures -.
Postoperatively, the patient had an uncomplicated course and he immediately had full recovery of his symptoms related to autonomic dysreflexia. At a six-month follow-up, the patient continued to have full relief of his symptoms of autonomic dysreflexia.","

CR_ENG_154,English,"A 75-year-old woman with a past medical history of hypertension presented to our teaching institution with constipation for four days complicated by increasing confusion the previous 24 hours. She also reported abdominal fullness and bloating. On her arrival at the emergency department, she was tachycardic to 104 beats per minute. Blood pressure was 105/87 mmHg and she was also tachypneic at 24 breaths per minute. Significant clinical findings included altered mental status with an eye-opening response to pain, incomprehensible sounds, and flexion withdrawal to pain (Glasgow Coma Scale 8 - E2V2M4). On abdominal examination, she was distended; however, the patient could not be adequately assessed for peritonitis due to her altered mental status. Digital rectal examination showed impacted fecal matter. In view of altered mental status, the patient was immediately intubated for airway control.

She had elevated lactate of 7 mmol/L and a creatinine 2.85 mg/dL. An arterial blood gas analysis at the time showed a pH of 7.19, pCO2 52 mmHg, PO2 410 mmHg, and bicarbonate 19 mEq/L. In view of mixed acidosis, fluid resuscitation was initiated.
An emergent CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast prior to intubation was positive only for loaded fecal matter in the colon (Figure ) and a loaded sigmoid colon (Figure ).
CT scan of the head revealed no acute pathological process. In view of acidosis and concern for ischemic bowel, the patient was emergently taken for an exploratory laparotomy which showed patchy regions of the ischemic cecum, ascending colon, transverse colon, descending colon, sigmoid colon, and proximal rectum (Figure ). The stomach and small bowel up to ileocecal junction had a normal appearance. An intraoperative Doppler study showed patent superior and inferior mesenteric arteries and patent vasculature in the mesentery of the small bowel. The patient underwent subtotal colectomy and an end ileostomy. Postoperatively, the patient's lactic acidosis trended back to normal over the next few days, and there was a return of mental status as per the family. The pathology report of the resected colon specimen showed benign ischemic necrosis. The patient had the return of ostomy function and was tolerating tube feeds; however, due to poor physical condition, renal failure, and need for prolonged intubation, the patient’s family decided to transition to hospice and palliative care.","

CR_ENG_157,English,"A 71-year-old male patient, smoker, presented to our emergency department with a 1-day-history of diffuse crampy abdominal pain. Past surgical history included laparotomy for intestinal obstruction and right inguinal hernia repair. The pain was associated with obstipation and multiple episodes of vomiting.
On physical examination, the patient was hemodynamically stable and afebrile. His abdominal examination revealed abdominal distention, hyperactive bowel sounds on auscultation, diffuse tympanic sound on percussion and diffuse mild tenderness on palpation. No hernia was noted and no palpable mass was identified. Laboratory tests were remarkable for mild leukocytosis (WBC 11 000/μl).
An upright plain X-ray of the abdomen was obtained and showed dilated small-bowel loops, mainly in the left upper abdomen, along with multiple air-fluid levels (). The findings were compatible with small bowel obstruction. The etiology was then thought to post-laparotomy adhesions. The patient was admitted to the hospital and a nasogastric tube was inserted. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis with oral contrast demonstrated a sac-like lesion of 105 cm in the left hemi abdomen containing oral contrast with multiple oval shaped macro-calcifications (). A transition zone is noted at this level.
Accordingly, an exploratory laparotomy was decided upon: it revealed dense adhesions that were removed. Small bowel running brought out diffusely occurring JD (), one of which, located proximally, was surprisingly giant and hard ().
Segmental (20 cm) resection of the proximal jejunum, including the giant diverticulum and most of the others, with end-to-end jejuno-jejunostomy was then performed. Enteroliths were extracted from biggest diverticulum ().
The histopathological examination showed diverticulosis of the jejunum with serosal fibrosis, hemorrhage, calcifications and inflammatory changes.

CR_ENG_158,English,"A 6-year-old male with early infantile encephalopathy, global developmental delay,
and recurrent respiratory infections since the first year of life, visited the
emergency room of a community hospital with low-grade fever, irritability, and
grunting on day 1 of the disease. During the physical examination, the patient
presented skin pallor, 88% peripheral oxygen saturation, signs of respiratory
distress, and pulmonary auscultation with diminished respiratory sounds and crackles
on the lower half of the left hemithorax. Laboratory findings included: hemoglobin
11.0 g/dL, white blood cell count 12,100/uL with 9.8% lymphocytes and 71.6%
neutrophils, platelets 640,000/uL, and C-reactive protein (CRP) 103 mg/L. The chest
X-ray showed hypolucency on the left hemithorax. The patient was admitted and
initiated amoxicillin plus clavulanic acid 50 mg/kg/day, twice a day, intravenously.
On day 2, multiloculated pleural effusion was detected with thoracic ultrasound.
Next, the child underwent a left thoracic drainage with drain placement; the pleural
fluid was macroscopically purulent, and the laboratory analysis revealed a fluid
with 62,700 cells/mm3 (85% neutrophils), pH 6.5, glucose <5 mg/dL,
total protein 5 g/dL, cholesterol 80 mg/dL, triglycerides 36 mg/dL, adenosine
deaminase 45 U/L, and lactate dehydrogenase 1,440 U/L; cultures were also requested.
At this stage, antibiotic therapy was changed to ceftriaxone 80 mg/kg/day. In the
following 48 hours, the patient had clinical improvement, without fever or
respiratory distress. The bacteriological examination of the pleuritic fluid
identified Streptococcus anginosus, sensitive to penicillin and
cefotaxime; blood cultures were sterile.
On day 11, the child had a recurrence of fever, and the left pulmonary sounds ceased.
At this point, the child was transferred to a tertiary hospital, and his blood test
revealed leukocytosis (38,000/uL) with neutrophilia (81.7%), thrombocytosis
(843,000/uL), and elevated CRP (122 mg/L). He had an ill-appearance, severe signs of
respiratory distress, and hypoxemia. Thoracic computed tomography scan showed left
empyema, atelectasis, and consolidation with necrosis on the lower pulmonary left
lobe (). Abdominal abscesses and
endocarditis were excluded by abdominal ultrasound and echocardiogram. Clindamycin
(30 mg/kg/day, 4x a day, intravenously) was added to the therapy for anaerobic
coverage as the clinical state of the child was severe.
On day 12, the patient underwent a left decortication via video-assisted
thoracoscopic surgery, which revealed large fibrin deposits and adhesions between
the lung and the pleura; two thoracic drains were placed and kept for eight days.
The patient showed significant clinical improvement in the first 24 hours after
surgery. Pulmonary sounds gradually improved, and he had a full recovery after a
four-week course of ceftriaxone and a two-week course of clindamycin. In the
follow-up one and three weeks after discharge (), the child was well, and the chest X-ray was normal.","

CR_ENG_160,English,"A 7-year-old boy was admitted for excision of a cystic swelling at the posterior aspect of the base of the tongue a few centimeters anterior to the valleculae. The smallest laser endotracheal tube (ETT) available was of 7-mm outer diameter (OD) and an internal diameter of 5.5 mm. After induction of anesthesia with propofol, followed by administration of suxamethonium intravenously (IV), nasotracheal intubation was done with this tube. Anesthesia was maintained oxygen in air, atracurium, intermittent boluses of propofol, and fentanyl IV. Throat was packed with saline-soaked roller gauze.
The saline-soaked throat pack was obstructing the field of vision of the surgeon and also restricting the outward pull of the tongue as cyst was large (3 × 3 cm) and placed posteriorly. The throat pack was removed to facilitate surgery. The surgeon assured that adequate precautions would be taken to avoid bringing the diode laser delivery handle tip in contact with the ETT. Toward the end of the surgical laser excision, the tip of the handle accidently slipped and touched the ETT. We heard a very short “pop” like noise which lasted for about 1–2 s. The exhaled gas from the expiratory valve also smelt of smoke for about a minute or so. There was however no change in hemodynamics, drop in SpO2 or reduction in air entry/chest expansion. We discontinued oxygen and ventilated with air. As the surgery had been completed and we were able to ventilate the lungs, we reversed the neuromuscular blockade. A small dose of IV steroid dexamethasone (4 mg IV) was given. After tracheal extubation, a flexible laryngopharyngoscope was passed to visualize the trachea up to the carina and fortunately everything appeared to be normal.
The removed ETT [] had a very small circular hole and the inner aspect of the tube was black distal to the hole []. The cuff was intact but the tubing from the pilot balloon to the cuff was damaged, which is typically seen in “interior blow-torch phenomenon.” Patient recovered well and was shifted to postoperative, ward, monitored and given humidified oxygen and discharged next day.","

CR_ENG_161,English,"A 68-year-old hypertensive and diabetic lady presented with multiple bilateral cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy. Six months before this visit, she presented with a solitary left cervical lymphadenopathy which on excision biopsy showed features of hyaline-vascular type of Castleman's disease. Physical examination on the second visit revealed multiple bilateral cervical and left-sided axillary lymph nodes that were non-tender, discrete, firm in consistency and ranged in size from 0.5 to 8 cm. No organomegaly or constitutional symptoms were noted. Routine investigations such as complete blood count and biochemical profile (including hepatic function tests) were found to be within normal range except for mildly raised globulins (3.9 g/dl). Bone marrow aspiration done showed normal reactive marrow. Chest X-ray and computerized tomography (CT) scan of abdomen was normal. CT of thorax revealed left axillary adenopathy but mediastinum and lung fields were normal. Patient was seronegative for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) by Western blot method.
Inspite of a course of antibiotics there was no reduction in lymphadenopathy in the 2nd visit. Hence clinically, a recurrent Castleman's disease was suspected and the largest axillary lymph node was excised and sent for histopathological confirmation. The biopsy showed partial effacement of lymph node architecture with expansion of paracortical and interfollicular regions.
Hyalinized follicles, interfollicular vascular proliferation and paracortical collection of plasma cells were also seen []. The interfollicular region showed polymorphous population of cells composed of eosinophils, neutrophils, plasma cells and binucleate/mononuclear atypical cells with abundant cytoplasm having inclusion like eosinophilic nucleoli with perinucleolar halo that resembled Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells [, inset].
A panel of immunohistochemical (IHC) markers on tissue sections showed positivity for CD15 and CD30 with negative staining for CD 45 in RS-like cells and few background lymphocytes showed CD 20 positivity []. At this point, the previous lymph node biopsy sections were reviewed and no evidence of Hodgkin's disease was found. Correlating the clinical, histomorphology and immunohistochemistry, the final diagnosis of Castleman's disease (hyaline vascular type) with a coexistent interfollicular Hodgkin's lymphoma (Stage IIA) was arrived at.
The patient was given three cycles of chemotherapy with COPP (Cyclophosphamide, Oncovin, Procarbazine and Prednisolone). She developed hyperglycemia, hence the chemotherapeutic drugs were changed to ABVD (Adriamycin, Bleomycin, Vinblastine, Dicarbazine) regimen for the next three cycles.

After subsequent disease progression, a rebiopsy of the primary lesion revealed the EGFR T790M mutation. Erlotinib was again administered for 8 months until disease progression in a clinical trial.
Six days after erlotinib discontinuation, the patient was urgently hospitalised as a result of severe fatigue, appetite loss and a slight headache. Her Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (PS) had deteriorated to 3 on the day of admission. MRI of the brain revealed LMC and multiple brain metastases (
A, B). Progression at extracranial sites was not observed. As a seventh-line treatment, osimertinib was administered at a dose of 80 mg, resulting in relief of symptoms within a few days. MRI at 7 weeks after initiation of osimertinib showed shrinkage of the multiple nodular deposits in the brain (
C, D), and treatment is currently ongoing and well tolerated.","

CR_ENG_163,English,"A 56-year-old Caucasian woman with a 20-year history of type II diabetes mellitus presented with increased fatigue, bilateral lower extremity edema, and tightness of her skin in her lower extremities in 2012. Her primary care physician evaluated her cellular blood counts, chemistries, and thyroid-stimulating hormone, and obtained an echocardiogram. All of these studies were normal. A sleep study revealed mild obstructive sleep apnea, which was treated.
Within six months, in addition to lower extremity skin thickening, she developed dyspnea, Raynaud’s phenomenon, and digital ulcerations. She was referred to a rheumatologist at that time and found to be positive for anti-nuclear antibodies, at 1:640 in a nucleolar pattern, and RNA polymerase III antibody. Tests for other SSc antibodies, including anti-centromere, anti-fibrillin, anti-topoisomerase, and anti-Th/To, were negative. Her blood pressure and creatinine were noted to be normal. Her hemoglobin A1c was 7.6%. She was not on an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACE-I).
At a rheumatology appointment six months after her initial symptoms started, pulmonary function tests demonstrated an isolated decrease in diffusing capacity (38% predicted). A repeat echocardiogram suggested the interim development of moderate pulmonary hypertension with an estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 45mmHg and an impaired relaxation pattern of left ventricular filling. A computed tomography scan of her chest did not reveal the presence of a pulmonary embolism, and there was no evidence of interstitial lung disease. Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) did not show any delayed enhancement that would suggest prior myocardial injury or infarction. The images revealed that she had normal stress and resting perfusion, as well as hyperdynamic left ventricular function with an ejection fraction of 77% and no wall motion abnormalities. However, there was mild bi-atrial enlargement and her right ventricle was dilated with normal right ventricular systolic function. A right heart catheterization established the diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension, with right atrial pressure of 12mmHg, right ventricular pressure of 53/17mmHg, pulmonary arterial (PA) pressure of 45/16mmHg (mean, 33mmHg), wedge pressure of 20mmHg, cardiac output of 7L/min, cardiac index of 3.5L/min, and peripheral vascular resistance of 2 Wood units. She was noted to be anemic with a hemoglobin level of 7.4g/dL.
Based on her cardiac catheterization results, she was treated with diuresis and a phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor. At her one-month follow-up visit after the cardiac catheterization, her digital ulcerations were healing and lower extremity edema was improved, but her modified Rodnan skin score had worsened by six points (27 to 33). Methotrexate was prescribed, but our patient reported intolerable nausea after two doses. Owing to the anemia, she had an upper endoscopy. This led to a diagnosis of gastric antral vascular ectasia that was treated with argon plasma coagulation. Our patient was hesitant to continue methotrexate, thus mycophenolate mofetil was prescribed. Our patient did not receive any steroid therapy.
One year after her initial symptom of SSc, she had a scleroderma renal crisis (SRC), with a presenting blood pressure of 178/76mmHg and creatinine level of 1.77mg/dL. Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia was not present. Our patient was hospitalized and her blood pressure was controlled with an ACE-I. Our patient attended follow-up visits every other month for the next four months. Despite well-controlled blood pressure; echocardiogram improvement (normal ejection fraction); resolution of anemia following treatment for gastric antral vascular ectasia; creatinine stabilization (1.44mg/dL); and modified Rodnan skin score stabilization (maximum 38), our patient reported progressive fatigue and weakness. An electromyogram, nerve conduction studies, and levels of muscle enzymes were normal, and physical therapy was prescribed. She reported mild improvement in all symptoms at a follow-up visit two months later.
One year after her diagnosis of SSc and two months after her last clinic appointment, our patient was hospitalized for acute onset left-sided heart failure, with an ejection fraction of 20% documented by echocardiogram. An ECG revealed that her sinus rhythm and cardiac enzyme levels were normal. A repeat right and left heart catheterization showed a right atrial pressure of 19mmHg, right ventricular pressure of 64/7mmHg, PA pressure of 69/27mmHg (mean, 39mmHg), wedge pressure of 19mmHg, cardiac output of 6.8L/min, cardiac index of 3.3L/min, and only mild luminal abnormalities in her right coronary and left circumflex arteries. During this hospitalization, our patient stated that if she were to die, she wished to donate her body to science to help further physician understanding of SSc. One day after making this statement, she died of pulseless electrical activity, despite being followed closely at a clinic dedicated to SSc care and having no limitations to access.
An autopsy was immediately performed. She had cardiac enlargement, right and left ventricular chamber dilatation, pleural effusions, hepatosplenomegaly, and ascites indicative of heart failure. Atherosclerosis of her right coronary artery with 20% occlusion of the lumen was identified. Sections of her right and left ventricles, and septum showed focal interstitial fibrosis (Figure ). There was mild perivascular fibrosis in her left ventricle. Trichrome staining confirmed the presence of collagen; there were no other microvascular changes. There was myocyte hypertrophy, but no signs of inflammation. Her lungs showed moderate interstitial fibrosis, septal thickening, and large arteries with intima fibrosis. Segments of her esophagus, stomach, small bowel, and large bowel showed marked collagen deposition in the lamina propria. There was moderate autolysis without significant inflammation. Sections of her kidney showed several globally sclerotic glomeruli, moderate fibrous arterial intimal thickening, and interstitial fibrosis. There were no inflammatory infiltrates, casts, or crystals. There was glomerular enlargement, nodular increases in mesangial matrix, and capillary wall thickening consistent with nodular diabetic glomerulosclerosis. No thrombotic microangiopathy of the small vessels was noted. Her bone marrow was hypercellular for age but showed trilineage hematopoiesis with an approximately normal ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursors. No other significant abnormalities were reported. The pathologist reported her likely cause of death as a fatal dysrhythmia due to myocardial fibrosis and atherosclerosis.
Metabolomics were used to investigate which metabolism and signaling pathways played a key role in her heart failure. For this investigation, the heart was immediately placed in a −80°C freezer. Subsequent quantitative analysis of a large number of small metabolites (<1000Da) within a cell or tissue and principle component analysis allow maximum variation in the data to be described, providing a fingerprint of physiological and pathophysiological status. In our study, the comparative analyses of metabolomes were performed by a combined approach of gas chromatography–mass spectrometry spectroscopic techniques with subsequent computer analysis of the data generated. Our patient’s tissue was compared to averages of 79 metabolites in 16 other patients who suffered cardiac death. In our patient, the essential amino acids (2-aminoadipic acid, lysine, valine, leucine, alanine, glutamic acid, proline, aspartic acid, asparagine, methionine, cysteine, tyrosine, and histidine) were the most elevated metabolic class. Our patient’s lipid, peptide, and carbohydrate metabolites were similar to those in the other 16 patients tested. Of interest, despite her history of SRC, our patient’s creatinine level was lower than any of the other samples tested.","

CR_ENG_164,English,"An 18-year-old boy was transferred to our hospital complaining of a 2-month history of neck pain. The patient had no history of surgery or trauma and no motor weakness. Computed tomography (CT) of the spine showed osteolytic bony destruction of the T1 body involving the pedicle and spinous process (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the spine revealed a bony cystic mass with internal septation and fluid-fluid levels at the T1 vertebra (Fig. A and B). The mass was extended to the pedicle and spinous process, and showed heterogeneous signal intensity on T1- and T2-weighted images. The cyst wall and internal septation were enhanced (Fig. C and D). There was also a soft tissue mass and cord compression. The T1 vertebral body was destroyed.
On angiographic examination, there were several feeders through the thyrocervical trunk and we embolized these feeders with glue (Fig. A and B). Six days after embolization, T1 corpectomy was performed via an anterior approach. The tumor was pinkish, friable and highly vascular. Although we performed preoperative SAE to prevent significant intraoperative bleeding, massive tumor bleeding occurred during the operation. Bleeding control was difficult because the operative field was narrow, and the tumor could not be fully exposed. After the bleeding controlled, anterior interbody fusion with titanium graft placement and cervical plating from C7 to T2 was performed. We performed the operation using the posterior approach 1 week after the anterior approach. The lesion had involved the T1 pedicle, spinous process and paraspinal muscles. After gross total tumor excision, posterior screw fixation was performed from C6 to T3 (Fig. ). Histopathological examination confirmed the diagnosis of ABC. His presenting neck pain was improved soon after surgery and no neurologic deterioration occurred during the postoperative period.

CR_ENG_166,English,"In February 2010, a 41-year-old female presented with a 6-week history of headaches, nasal congestion, epistaxis, difficulty opening her mouth and ptosis of the right eyelid. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan revealed a complex multilobulated mass centered within the right cavernous sinus, the cavernous internal carotid artery being encased [Figures and ]. Laterally, the tumor extended to the petrous bone and partially encased the right petrous carotid artery. Also noted was tumor extension into Meckel's cave, the right prepontine cistern and masticator space via the course of the second branch of the trigeminal nerve. The differential diagnosis included meningioma, and metastatic disease. The rapid progression of symptoms and the atypical imaging appearance of the lesion strongly suggested the latter. In that the tumor lay just lateral to the pituitary gland, a diagnosis of pituitary adenoma was unlikely.

CR_ENG_167,English,"A 64-year-old male was referred to our hospital in 2009 due to a 1-year history of facial swelling and weight gain. CT scans revealed a pituitary mass (2.3 × 1.3 × 1.1 cm) involving the cavernous sinuses (Figure and ); laboratory test results were within normal limits with the exception of ACTH levels, which were elevated to 113 pg/mL (normal <46 pg/mL). The patient did not consent to surgery because he had undergone a permanent pacemaker implantation for sinus bradycardia in 2008 and was concerned about the risks associated with anesthesia and operation. Therefore, GKS was performed instead of surgery in May 2009. Six months after GKS, the patient's face puffiness and weight gain symptoms had improved, and CT scans showed that the pituitary mass decreased slightly in size (Figure and ). Although the patient also developed secondary hypothyroidism, the associated symptoms improved after levothyroxine replacement treatment. In June 2011, the patient's face puffiness and weight gain returned, and CT scans in May 2012 showed significant progression of the tumor (Figure and ). In August 2012, the patient also began to experience visual impairment in the left eye. CT scans revealed that the pituitary was greatly enlarged and that the sphenoid and cavernous sinuses were involved (Figure and ). Laboratory tests in October 2012 showed that ACTH, serum cortisol, and 24h-UFC levels were elevated to 669 pg/mL, 54.84 μg/dL (normal: 4-22.3 μg/dL), and 485 μg (normal: 12.3-103 μg), respectively (Figure ). In November 2012, TSS was performed and the tumor was partially resected. Pathology revealed ACTH-positive immunostaining in 80% of cells, a Ki-67 labeling index (LI) of greater than 5%, and strong immunoreactivity for p53 in nearly 90% of the tumor cells (Figure ). After the operation, ACTH and serum cortisol levels decreased to 90.1 pg/mL and 24.43 μg/dL, respectively; however, 24h-UFC levels increased to 1168 μg (Figure ). In May 2013, the patient presented with further visual impairment and diplopia in left eye and moon face. CT scans indicated that the residual tumor had regrown (Figure and ). The patient's ACTH and serum cortisol levels increased to 495 pg/mL and 31.25 μg/dL respectively, while his 24h-UFC levels decreased to 623 μg (Figure ). In August 2013, radiotherapy was performed to treat further tumor progression. Six months after radiotherapy, ACTH, serum cortisol, and 24h-UFC levels decreased to 341.0 pg/mL, 12.95 μg/dL, and 73.60 μg, respectively (Figure ), and the patient's Cushing syndrome, but not his visual impairment and diplopia, improved significantly. However, in December 2014, the patient presented with an aggravation of the visual impairment in the left eye and the right abducent nerve palsy, and CT scan revealed that the pituitary adenoma had regrown and infiltrated through the sphenoid bones into the sphenoid and cavernous sinuses (Figure and ). The patient's ACTH, serum cortisol, and 24h-UFC levels had increased to 557 pg/mL, 28.68 μg/dL, and 510 μg, respectively (Figure ). After obtaining written consent, TMZ was administered at 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days every 28 days beginning in December 2014. After 3 cycles of TMZ, no virtual alteration in tumor size was observed by CT scan (Figure and ). However, ACTH, serum cortisol, and 24h-UFC levels decreased to 319 pg/mL, 13.3 μg/dL, and 55.29 μg, respectively (Figure ), and the patient's clinical symptoms improved significantly, including the recovery of extraocular movements and a reduced hypertension. After six cycles of TMZ treatment, serum cortisol and 24h-UFC levels had fallen into the normal range, and the ACTH level decreased to 310 pg/mL (Figure ). However, the patient presented with blepharoptosis in the right eye, hoarseness, bucking, and dysphagia, and the CT scan indicated that the tumor had enlarged rapidly and infiltrated the sphenoid and cavernous sinuses (Figure ). The patient then declined to continue TMZ treatment and returned home for terminal care.","

CR_ENG_168,English,"Our patient is a 47-year-old right-handed female who presented to the Family Medicine clinic for evaluation of her headaches. The patient stated that she started having headaches around the age of 10, which became frequent around her teens and early 20s. She typically described her headaches as a pressure sensation that would last from 10 to 30 minutes and occur about 6-8 times per day. The pain was mostly in the occipital or the periorbital area. She denied any tearing but did endorse nasal congestion on the side of the pain. Associated symptoms included nausea, photophobia, and phonophobia. She denied visual aura, ptosis, diplopia, blurry vision, nausea, vomiting or sensitivity to smell, dysphagia, dysarthria, dizziness, weakness, numbness, or tingling or any other neurological deficit. She could not identify any triggers but stated that initially, the headaches would only occur during the day. Later, the headaches also started occurring at night and waking her up from sleep. She denies a family history of headaches. She usually drinks two cups of coffee per day, and this practice has not changed in many years. There was no preceding history of any injuries, falls, or head trauma.
She saw a neurologist in her teens and was diagnosed with cluster headaches. The headaches improved in her late 20s and 30s but recently have worsened again. She states that about four years ago, she had headaches in the left occipital region, which lasted almost six weeks. She tried multiple over-the-counter medications such as Excedrin without any relief. Her prior primary care provider had also tried topiramate and amitriptyline without significant benefit.
Later, she could not follow up with her neurologist or headache specialist due to insurance issues. She then decided on getting daith piercing on the left side after hearing about it from her colleagues and friends. She underwent the piercing at a local tattoo shop in her town and stated that the left-sided headaches completely resolved almost immediately (Figure ).
She was asymptomatic till the beginning of March 2019 when the headaches returned but now on the right side. It was once again in the right occipital region. She stated that she would have episodes of headaches that lasted for almost four weeks and affected her activities of daily living. She had a daith piercing done on the right side, and the headaches resolved (Figure ).
The headaches gradually came back on the right side in December 2019 and lasted for almost two and a half weeks, after which she came to see us in the clinic. She stated that in the last two and a half weeks, she had tried multiple over-the-counter pain medications without much relief. She had been missing work being incapacitated with pain. She denied having used beta-blockers like propranolol or metoprolol, GABAergic agents like gabapentin, pregabalin, or anticonvulsants like lamotrigine or divalproex.
On examination, she was normocephalic. There were no palpable masses or tenderness on the face or head. Her neck exam was unremarkable, with no tenderness, and her neck movements were full. There were no meningeal signs. Spurling’s sign was negative. The rest of the neurological exam was within normal limits. Her visual acuity was reported 20/20 in each eye. The patient was also advised to see her optometrist immediately for a detailed examination, and there was no evidence of papilledema. We started the patient on verapamil 40 mg twice a day, as well as rizatriptan 10 mg PRN (with a max of three tabs in 24 hours) and ordered a computed tomography (CT) of her head without contrast. A referral to a neurologist was also made.
On the subsequent appointment, she reported a decrease in both the intensity and frequency of her headaches. We increased the dose of her verapamil to 40 mg every eight hours. She subsequently saw the neurologist who gave her a differential diagnosis of cluster headaches versus hemicrania continua. She was advised to continue with her current dose of verapamil.
Non-contrast CT head revealed no acute intracranial findings (Figure ).
Our patient continues to take some of her medications. However, she reports a marked improvement in her symptoms after daith piercing and is motivated to cut down on her medications.","

CR_ENG_169,English,"A 27-year-old African-Ugandan woman of Nilotic ethnicity presented to the Accident and Emergency Department of a tertiary hospital, following a GSI to her face. She was brought as a referral from a regional hospital, 300km away. The injury was the result of a 'stray’ bullet, shot from an AK-47 submachine gun at a distance of about 70m. At that time, she experienced intense pain over the right side of her face, collapsed and passed out for about 20 minutes. The amount and type of blood loss (arterial versus venous) was difficult to ascertain. She was rushed to the local regional hospital after bystanders had applied improvised bleeding-control measures (wrapping the head with clothing). Resuscitation and a surgical wound toilet were done without extension of the wound. Essential antibiotics and vaccines were administered, and the wound was dressed (not sutured). Injuries had been sustained over the right side of her face, leaving a large open wound.
She was referred to the tertiary hospital 10 days after these events. Her main complaints were right mandibular pain, with difficulty in opening her mouth and chewing, and inability to hear with her right ear. She was fully conscious and was hemodynamically stable but had moderate pallor. There was a laceration of her maxillomandibular area (6cm in length) with features of infected granulation tissue (Figure ). The right side of her maxillofacial region was swollen and tender. There was no active bleeding, subcutaneous emphysema, or dyspnea and stridor. She had only a very limited capacity to open her jaw, and even then with pain. There was no particularly painful area in her neck. Remarkable findings were revealed on cranial nerve examination. She had a right facial nerve palsy (lower motor neuron) and total loss of cutaneous sensation over the distribution of the right maxillary and mandibular branches of her trigeminal nerve in the maxillary and mandibular regions respectively. The ophthalmic division of her trigeminal nerve was intact. Her auditory function was assessed. A Rinne’s test revealed conduction deafness of her right ear; a Weber’s test showed that her auditory nerves were intact. Sensation over her neck was intact as well. Superficial temporal artery pulsation was present.
A plain radiograph of her head and neck (Figures and ) and an ultrasound scan of her neck, done prior to her referral, had revealed the presence of a bullet in the right side of her neck, anterior to cervical vertebrae 6 and 7. Basic as it is, this plain radiograph enabled identification of this important condition. It also revealed comminuted fracture of her mandible (angle and ramus) and maxillary antrum.
Subsequent management at our unit proceeded with exploration of the bullet entry wound. A comminuted fracture of the ramus and angle of her right mandible was confirmed. Debridement was done and the entry wound was closed. Fracture fixation was not done due to logistical obstacles. She was put on a course of parenteral antibiotics: clindamycin, 150mg, three times a day; ceftriaxone, 1g, twice a day, for 5 days. Analgesics (parenteral diclofenac, 75mg, three times a day; and morphine, 5mg, four times a day) were also administered.
The management plan was then focused on full establishment of the bullet’s trajectory with the aim of its extraction as deemed essential at this point in time, given the migratory tendency of foreign bodies (missiles) in the neck and subsequent vascular injury. Further evaluation involved conducting a CT scan of her head and neck 1 week after admission. This confirmed the earlier radiological findings; a bullet not only lodged in the right side of her neck but within her carotid sheath as well (Figure ). The CT scan however, showed that it was no longer positioned just anterior to cervical vertebrae 6 and 7, but also anterior to cervical vertebra 5; a shift in the cephalad direction ('wandering’ or 'migration’) from what the previous radiographs showed. This could be a real shift or an apparent one, due to some cervical flexion during the CT procedure. It was lateral to her trachea, posterolateral to her common carotid artery, and just posterior and intimate with her internal jugular vein, within her carotid sheath.
A decision to remove the bullet operatively was made in view of the 'wandering’ scenario. A right longitudinal cervical incision, just posterior and parallel to her sternocleidomastoid muscle, was used to access the posterior triangle of her neck. The investing deep fascia was dissected and her carotid sheath opened. The bullet was identified, confined within a pocket of debris (Figure ). There were no signs of suppuration, and acute inflammation had resolved. The debris possibly consisted of damaged tissue encountered along the trajectory of the bullet: parotid gland tissue, blood, nerve and muscle remnants. The bullet was extracted, debris was flushed out thoroughly with normal saline (50mL) and her sheath was closed with Vicryl 2–0 continuous suture (Figure ). Subcutaneous sutures (Vicryl 3/0, interrupted) were placed. Her postoperative recovery was uneventful.
The way forward then was: to fix the mandibular fracture; explore the possibilities of nerve repair and facial/mastication muscle re-establishment of function; and to conduct a full auditory workup to assess the extent of damage with the aim of restoration of function or rehabilitation. Unfortunately, due to socioeconomic reasons, she has not yet had this done and has had to leave hospital with the following injuries still outstanding: auditory conduction damage; facial, mandibular and maxillary nerve damage; and, mandibular and maxillary antrum fractures.","

CR_ENG_171,English,"A 59-year-old woman called the University of California San Diego Shiley Eye Institute triage line complaining of diplopia. At the time, spring 2020, governor-mandated restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic had temporarily suspended elective medical care. Over the phone, the patient described a history of sudden onset of horizontal binocular double vision, which she noticed one day prior while driving. During the preceding two weeks, she also felt intermittent episodes of the “room spinning,” although she endorsed prior similar vertiginous episodes in the past that had self-resolved. Additionally, she reported a new frontal headache on the day of presentation. She was advised to present to the ophthalmology clinic emergently for an in-person, face-to-face evaluation. However, she declined due to concerns regarding COVID-19 but agreed to a same-day telemedicine video visit.
Before the video visit, she was provided with resources and links for tools to help obtain relevant ophthalmic data. For visual acuity assessment, she was sent a link to a Snellen visual acuity chart that could be printed for use at home (Safe Eyes America, Washington, DC, USA). For extraocular movements, she was asked to use a mobile application (9 Gaze app, See Vision LLC, Richmond, VA, USA) to document eye motility and alignment in the nine cardinal positions of gaze. The app provides a guide to users to facilitate correct eye positioning and image consistency and produces a composite image of the photographs for easy exporting.
The video visit was conducted with a strabismus specialist using a telemedicine platform (Doxy.me LLC, Rochester, NY, USA) compliant with the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act. The patient wore bifocals for distance and near-vision correction, but no other ocular history. Her medical history was notable for hypertension, which was well-controlled on losartan. She had no known medication allergies. She had undergone a prior Caesarean section but had no other surgical history. Her social history and family medical history was unremarkable.
Her visual acuity measured by the at-home Snellen chart was 20/20 in both eyes. Images from her motility examination obtained from the mobile app () were reviewed, and she was also asked to repeat the extraocular movements during the video visit. She was noted to have a subtle, small abduction deficit in the right eye, best seen when she turned her face to the left. In primary gaze, she had a small angle esotropia noted when she was verbally prompted to perform a cover–uncover test, with her own hand serving as an occluder. When prompted, the patient noted that the double vision was worse in right gaze. She could generate a normal saccade to abduction in the right eye. Taken together, these findings were consistent with an acute onset subtle sixth cranial nerve palsy. The remainder of her video examination, including pupil anatomy, confrontation visual fields, and gross examination of the ocular adnexa and anterior segment, appeared unremarkable.
A wide differential was considered, including tumour, ischemia/cerebrovascular accident, increased intracranial pressure, trauma, infection, inflammation, and migraine. Other possibilities included orbital mass, myasthenia gravis, and thyroid eye disease. Initial laboratory work-up included a complete blood count, basic metabolic panel, anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies, and thyroid-related testing. Emergent neuroimaging was ordered, including computed tomography (CT) of the head and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits with and without contrast. Findings on the MRI were concerning for an aneurysm, which prompted further investigation with CT angiography of the head and neck. Taken together, the neuroimaging revealed a partially thrombosed and partially calcified giant right cavernous internal carotid artery (ICA) aneurysm, measuring 3.4 × 3.1 × 2.6 cm, which was unruptured (). There was decreased enhancement of the right ophthalmic artery compared to the left, and indication of erosion of the sphenoid bone. There were also other small aneurysms visualized, including a 2 mm aneurysm projecting from the left ICA terminus, and a 1–2 mm aneurysm at the origin of the right superior cerebellar artery.
Given these findings, the patient was emergently referred to neurosurgery for consultation. Due to the large size of the aneurysm and its dysmorphic features making it high risk for rupture, the patient was not considered a candidate for open surgical management. She was immediately referred to the interventional neuroradiology/endovascular neurosurgery service and subsequently underwent pipeline flow-diverting embolization and coil embolization of the right ICA aneurysm. Of note, besides the neuroimaging acquisition and the embolization procedure itself, all neurosurgical consultations and follow-up visits were also conducted via telemedicine video visits. During her most recent visit to ophthalmology, about two months after initial presentation, she was doing well and endorsed improved diplopia, and her vertigo had resolved. She did not have any neurological or cognitive deficits.
This patient provided written consent for her history, exam, photographs, and imaging studies to be included in this report.","

CR_ENG_172,English,"A 43-year-old male waiter was hit in the glabella region with a bottle by a customer.
He sustained a depressed skull fracture of the frontal and nasal bones, classified as a ‘bi-lateral Markowitz type 1’ nasoorbitoethmoidal fracture (). The fracture extended through to the anterior cranial fossa and cribiform plate. He presented with double vision on upward gaze and on gaze up and left. On examination there was restriction of elevation of the right eye in adduction (Figure ).
A pre-operative orthoptic assessment (Hess chart [Appendix B.1]), field of binocular single vision (BSV) (Appendix A.1) and motility testing in the nine cardinal views of gaze (Appendix C), confirmed a right traumatic Brown syndrome.
A neuro-ophthalmology examination was otherwise unremarkable, with normal optic nerve function (normal visual acuity, pupillary reactions, fundus examination, colour vision and visual fields).
Surgical access was obtained via a coronal flap, retracted down to the supra-orbital margins.
A step in the frontal bone superior to the nasofrontal suture was identified, reduced and fixed with a 1.3 mm ‘Y’ plate and 6 mm screws. The nasal bone fractures were exposed para-nasally through intra-oral incisions and fixed with two titanium plates with 4 mm screws. The nose was then stabilised with a splint and intra-nasal packs. There was no intra-orbital intervention.

CR_ENG_173,English,"A 90-year-old female complaining of severe upper abdominal pain was transferred to our institution in December 2012. The patient's history included angina pectoris, which was treated using coronary stents and dual antiplatelet therapy. The patient was treated with hemodialysis for myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (MPO-ANCA) associated glomerulonephritis and had been receiving CPS (ARGAMATE) for the treatment of hyperkalemia. On admission, the patient was confirmed to be in shock with the following signs: blood pressure, 77/55 mm Hg; heart rate, 82 beats/min; body temperature, 36.5°C; oxygen saturation, 92% on room air. On clinical examination, her weight, height, and body mass index were 40.6 kg, 139 cm, and 20.9 kg/m2, respectively. Inspection of the palpebral conjunctiva revealed evidence of severe anemia. Chest auscultation revealed no evidence of abnormal heart murmurs and no rales or other lung sounds. The abdomen revealed diffuse tenderness, with signs of peritoneal irritation. Physical examination revealed whole body cyanosis. Blood chemical analyses () revealed markedly decreased white blood cell counts (1600/μL), severe anemia (red blood cell counts: 234 × 104/μL; hemoglobin levels, 7.9 g/dL), severely decreased platelet counts (6.0 × 104/μL), increased serum urea nitrogen levels (39.3 mg/dL), markedly increased serum creatinine levels (5.35 mg/dL), severe hypoproteinemia (3.5 g/dL), severe hypoalbuminemia (3.0 g/dL), increased glucose levels (199 mg/dL), increased brain natriuretic peptide levels (299.0 pg/mL), mildly increased C-reactive protein levels (1.0 mg/dL), and coagulation dysfunction (prothrombin time, 18%; fibrin/fibrinogen degradation products, 15.6 μg/mL; D-dimer levels, 3.9 μg/mL). Blood gas analyses revealed mild metabolic acidosis (bicarbonate ion carbonic acid, 19.7 mmol/mL; base excess, −4.6 mmol/L). Chest and abdominal radiography revealed free air under bilateral diaphragms, suggesting intestinal perforation (Figures and ). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed the presence of ascites, free air in the abdominal cavity, and the retention of hard stools in the left-sided colon (Figures and ). The diagnosis of intestinal perforation was immediately confirmed; subsequently, the patient underwent emergency surgical treatment. Surgical findings (Figures and ) revealed a 55 × 22 mm perforated site in the middle of the descending colon surrounded with hard stools. No diverticulum was evident in the colon. The descending colon, including the affected site, was resected, and a colostomy was created in the transverse colon. Histopathology of the perforated colon revealed basophilic polygonal crystalline materials, which suggested the association of CPS with this perforation (). Crystalline materials were negative for PAS, Ziehl-Neelsen, and Congo-red stains (Figures , , and ). The postoperative course was eventful: the patient went into septic shock and developed acute respiratory distress as well as multiple organ failure. The patient eventually died of panperitonitis on day 3 of admission.","

CR_ENG_174,English,"An eleven-year-old boy presented to the University Hospital of the West Indies, Jamaica, with a history of neurodevelopmental regression with onset at the age of seven when he ceased speaking. By the age of 10 he was unable to sit unsupported or to self-care. He displayed aggressive behavior and dystonic posturing of the limbs, trunk, and the oromandibular region which subsided with sleep. He later developed swallowing difficulty. There was no family history of consanguinity or neurological disease and the perinatal period was normal.
Examination revealed an agitated boy who communicated using gestures and obeyed simple commands. His weight and height were <5th centile; the head circumference was normal. There were minor dysmorphic features, generalized muscle wasting, and limb contractures. Fundoscopy revealed bilateral disc pallor and mid-peripheral hyperpigmentation with bony spicules. The gag reflex was weak. Tongue thrusting, forceful jaw opening, and axial and appendicular dystonia were noted. He was noted to use the hand to forcibly close his jaw. There was weakness at the wrists and ankles. Deep tendon reflexes were normal.
On laboratory examination, there was mild elevation of hepatic transaminases. Ceruloplasmin, serum, and urinary copper levels were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain demonstrated symmetric changes of homogenous T2 hypointensity in both globus pallidi. In addition, there were discrete foci of T2 hyperintensity at the anteromedial aspect in the bilateral globus pallidi. This appearance is commonly referred to as the “eye of the tiger” sign. The brain parenchyma was otherwise normal ().
He was diagnosed with neurodegeneration associated with brain iron accumulation (NABI), also referred to as pantothenate kinase-associated neurodegeneration (PKAN). Molecular confirmation was not possible. He was treated with L-dopa/carbidopa and experienced marked reduction of the dystonia, improved hand eye coordination, and reduced dystonia.

CR_ENG_175,English,"A 40-year-old female presented with the complaint of a feeling of tightness in the right lower limb in 2007. She used to get abnormal posturing of right lower limb with pronounced downward flexion of the foot. This posturing used to be intermittent, painful, lasting for 3–4 h, triggered with walking and movements at the ankle joint. Later, she developed difficulty in bending the right knee as well. Her gait was deliberate and slow. Her husband noticed absence of leg posturing while she was asleep. She complained of decreased sleep and apprehension about the ailment. She had been treated with antidepressants and antipsychotic medications. She did not respond to medications and, subsequently, her symptoms worsened with stiffness spreading to the other limb, abdomen and neck. She started getting episodes of painful contractions of both lower limbs and abdominal muscles in response to unexpected stimuli such as noise, touch or emotional stress. She became bedridden over the next few months. Two years into the illness, she was diagnosed as having brittle diabetes mellitus, which was insulin dependent, with severe fluctuations of blood sugar levels. No other significant past medical or surgical history was noted. Her family history was not contributory. On examination, her vitals were stable and the lower limbs and trunk were tight to palpation. Paraspinal muscles were hypertrophied. She had normal strength, right foot dystonic posturing and no other extrapyramidal or pyramidal tract signs.
Thus, the main clinical findings were stiffness in the limbs and trunk and painful spasms triggered with sudden stimuli or movement. This raised the following differential diagnosis. Conditions like strychnine poisoning can have a similar constellation of symptoms, but it is acute in onset and very rapid in progression. After exposure 10–20 min later, the muscles become spasmodic, starting with the head and neck in the form of trismus and risus sardonicus, eventually spreading to every muscle in the body, with nearly continuous convulsions getting worse with the slightest stimulus.The convulsions progress, increasing in intensity and frequency until the backbone arches continually. Convulsions are followed by postictal depression. Death comes from asphyxia or by exhaustion from the convulsions. The subject dies within 2–3 h of exposure.[]
The symptoms observed in the acute form, such as painful spasmodic contraction of the voluntary muscles, usually involving the jaw, face and neck, less frequently those of the trunk, the extensors of the spine and limbs, will in time be seen in the chronic form, with the exception that a paroxysm is followed by an interval of varying duration when there is relaxation of the muscles and freedom from pain. During this interval, the patient is enabled to take nourishment and stimulants thus preventing the exhaustion seen in the acute attacks. When recovery takes place, which occurs far more frequently than in the acute form, the spasms occur at longer intervals and in a lighter form till they cease entirely. Relapses may occur, sometimes unexpectedly, and may terminate fatally.[] Our patient did not remember any injury with rusted steel.
This rare neuromuscular disorder is caused by hyperexcitability and continuous firing of the peripheral nerve axons that activate the muscle fibers. It includes progressive muscle stiffness, continuously contracting or twitching muscles (myokymia), cramping, increased and delayed muscle relaxation and sweating. These events tend to persist during sleep or when subjects are under local or general anesthesia. Onset is between ages 15 and 60 years, with most individuals experiencing symptoms before age 40. Stiffness is most prominent in the limb and trunk muscles, although symptoms may be limited to cranial muscles. It is characterized by rippling painful muscle spasms (which, contrary to those seen in the Stiff Person syndrome, persist after nerve block, anesthesia and sleep and have typical electromyographic findings) [].
Anticonvulsants, including Phenytoin and Carbamazepine, usually provide significant relief from the stiffness, muscle spasms and pain associated with Isaac's syndrome. Plasma exchange may provide short-term relief for individuals with some forms of the acquired disorder.[] Our patient's symptoms resemble this description to a large extent; however, the symptoms tended to disappear in sleep. The stimulus sensitivity seen in our patient was also unusual for the diagnosis.
It is an uncommon progressive disorder probably of autoimmune etiology, characterized by painful muscle spasms, alopecia, diarrhea and endocrinopathy such as amenorrhea and secondary skeletal abnormalities. Onset is between the age of 6 and 15 years. Disease presents with muscle spasms in the legs and alopecia[] [].
The spasms are painful and progressive, with the frequency varying up to 100 per day, each episode lasting a few minutes. The spasms usually spare the facial muscles. Diarrhea occurs in the first 2–3 years, with intolerance to carbohydrate and high-glucose diets. When the patient is in the attack-free period, nonstimulus-sensitive myoclonus can occur in the arms, legs and neck. It may be associated with endocrinal abnormalities such as amenorrhea and hypoplasia of the uterus. Affected children fail to attain height after 10–12 years of age. They develop bony deformities like genu varus/valgus, lumbar lordosis, etc.[] Our patient was older and did not have any manifestations outside the nervous system.
A rare neurological disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms. Electromyography (EMG ) studies show the presence of continuous motor activity in both agonist and antagonist muscles.[] In our patient, the clinical features of stimulus-sensitive spasms that were absent in sleep favored the diagnosis.
Routine hematological investigations were normal. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) was 7 mm/h. Blood sugars were fairly controlled. Creatine phosphokinase CPK (total) levels were normal. Magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and spine were normal. Her EMG studies showed presence of continuous motor activity, suggestive of Stiff Person syndrome [].
Her anti-GAD antibody was negative. Patient's work-up for malignancy, including computed tomography chest and abdomen and tumor markers (CA 125, AFP and CEA) was negative. Clinical history and investigations excluded tetanus, both acute and chronic, and strychnine poisoning and favored the possibilities of Stiff Person syndrome, Satoyoshi syndrome and neuromyotonia.
The patient was started on diazepam therapy, which provided definite but short-term symptomatic relief. In 2009, she developed exacerbation of spasmodic attacks ultimately leading to respiratory failure. The patient required ventilatory support. She was given a trial of IV-Ig 20 g/day for 5 days. She showed significant improvement in her symptoms. She could be weaned off the ventilator over the next 10–12 days, and became ambulatory over the next 6 weeks.
The patient enjoyed a symptom-free period of 1.5 years with occasional episodic exacerbations. However, since January 2011, her spasms increased in frequency. Her suffering progressed till June 2011, to an extent of severe functional disability because of pronounced tightness in the limbs and trunk. She was evaluated again. HbA1c 8.6%. Anti-GAD antibody titer was strongly positive, which was >2000 IU/ml (n <10 IU/ml). EMG showed continuous motor unit activity. Anti-TPO antibody titer was elevated substantially, being 882.86 units/ml (n < 5.08 units/ml). The patient was again given IV-Ig this time as well. She showed significant improvement. She was put on Diazepam 40 mg/day with baclofen 60 mg/day. She continues to remain well till date.
In 1956, Moersch and Woltmann coined the term Stiff Man syndrome. Stiff Person syndrome is a rare neurological disorder characterized by fluctuating muscle rigidity in the trunk and limbs and a heightened sensitivity to stimuli such as noise, touch and emotional distress, which can set off muscle spasms.[] It usually starts in the axial muscles and extends to the proximal limb muscles, but the severity of the limb muscle involvement may overwhelm the axial muscle involvement (Stiff Limb syndrome).[]
Females are relatively more affected than males. Age of onset varies from infancy to elderly age group. No genetic linkage is yet known. It is frequently associated with other autoimmune diseases such as diabetes (45–50%), thyroiditis, vitiligo and pernicious anemia. Association of epilepsy, breast cancer and cerebellar ataxia has also been reported.[]
The cause of the Stiff Person syndrome is unknown; however, an autoimmune pathogenesis is suspected because of: (1) the presence of antibodies against glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), the rate-limiting enzyme for the synthesis of the inhibitory neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid [GABA], (2) the association of the disease with other autoimmune conditions, (3) the presence of various autoantibodies and (4) a strong immunogenetic association. Anti-GAD antibodies, which are found in high titers in most patients, seem to be directed against conformational forms of GAD.[] In our patient, the initial negativity of anti-GAD antibody in the symptomatic stage is curious. New evidence suggests that these antibodies may be pathogenic because they interfere with the synthesis of GABA. In addition, a reduction in brain levels of GABA, which is prominent in the motor cortex, has been demonstrated with magnetic resonance spectroscopy in patients with the Stiff Person syndrome.[]
It usually involves the axial muscles, first complaining of backache and stiffness that gets worse with stress. There is disturbed sleep transition from rapid eye movement to non rapid eye movement REM-NREM . Brief episodes of dramatic worsening are common. At this stage, patients are often diagnosed to have either Fibromyalgia or are labeled psychogenic, as happened in our patient.[]
Later, the disease involves the proximal limbs. Spasms are stimulus sensitive. There is exaggerated lumbar lordosis and upright posturing with contraction of abdominal muscles. This spasmodic restriction causes extreme depression, which leads to severe impairment in the social functioning.[]
Eventually, facial and pharyngeal muscles get affected but trismus is absent. Joint deformities and skeletal fractures are quiet common. There is increased incidence of postsurgical hernia.[]
One variation of the disease, known as Stiff Limb syndrome, is observed more frequently in patients with diabetes mellitus. In this variation, the axial involvement is less marked and one or (rarely) more extremities are affected.[]
In the Stiff Baby syndrome, distal findings may be more pronounced than in adults. Smaller babies may have increased tonic extension of the leg at the hip. Younger patients frequently have a more pronounced response to startle than adults, and hyperekplexia must be considered in the differential diagnosis.[]
Spinal interneurons function to inhibit spontaneous discharges from the spinal motor neurons, primarily through the action of glycine. However, this is only one inhibitory input for the motor pathway that includes GABA-mediated inhibition from the cortex, brain stem and cerebellum. If GAD function is inhibited significantly, then GABA available for these functions is decreased and muscles become continuously stimulated by the motor neurons. The loss of GABAergic input into the motor neurons is thought to produce the tonic firing of motor neurons at rest and lead to their excessive excitation in response to sensory stimulation.[] Additional possible pathophysiologic etiologies in patients negative for GAD antibody include postsynaptic elements such as synaptophysin, amphiphysin, gephyrin and GABA-transaminase. The main autoantigen of the paraneoplastic form of Stiff Person syndrome is amphiphysin. In about 80% of the subjects with Stiff Person syndrome, disorder develops as nonparaneoplastic phenomenon in association with diabetes mellitus and polyendocrinopathy, often with antibodies to GAD.[]
Up to 65% of the patients may have antibodies against the two isoforms of GAD, GAD-65 and GAD-67. Because GAD is also present in the pancreatic cells, serum specimens from patients with the Stiff Person syndrome who are positive for anti-GAD antibodies also stain the β cells of the pancreas. Low titers of anti-GAD antibodies are detected in patients with type 1 diabetes, and up to 30% of patients with the Stiff Person syndrome also have diabetes. In contrast to patients with type 1 diabetes, the antibodies in patients with the Stiff Person syndrome seem to be against the conformational forms of GAD-65 and GAD-67, and recognize the denatured GAD-65 on Western blot assay. Differences in epitope specificity may explain why the incidence of the Stiff Person syndrome in persons with diabetes is low (about 1 in 10,000 persons).[]
In the paraneoplastic form, the stiffness is mostly in the proximal muscles and precedes the detection of the tumor. The most common tumor seems to be breast cancer. Patients with paraneoplastic cases of the Stiff Person syndrome do not have antibodies against GAD, but have antibodies against amphiphysin, another neuronal protein (molecular weight, 128 kDa) that is localized in neurons and synaptic vesicles.[]
Initial medical treatment may involve GABA-enhancing agents such as baclofen, benzodiazepine or gabapentin. Diazepam at 20–400 mg/day is the most potent symptomatic treatment. Clonazepam, valproic acid, clonidine, vigabatrin (which decreases catabolism of GABA) and tiagabine (which interferes with uptake of GABA) have also been reported to be effective.[]
In some patients, plasmapheresis has been demonstrated to be of clinical utility in the treatment of Stiff Person syndrome. No real prescribed dosage exists for plasmapheresis. A five-treatment series administered every other day is considered a standard regimen for autoimmune diseases, but longer and shorter regimens have also been used.[]
Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) has also been used in the inpatient setting for the treatment of Stiff Person syndrome. The usual dose is 2 g/kg, administered over 2–5 days.[]
Some patients may be candidates for intrathecal baclofen therapy for long-term treatment. Because symptoms may be variable, an externally programmable pump may be the best option. Baclofen pump therapy should not be considered the sole therapy for the disease. It may be fatal if not meticulously supervised.[]
Rituximab therapy has resulted in long-lasting remissions. Clinical trials of this treatment have been completed.[]
Treatment of the tumor and use of corticosteroids may improve the paraneoplastic form. Physical therapy and occupational therapy are critical to the recovery of the patient under treatment.[]
Patients with Stiff Person syndrome usually respond well to muscle relaxants, and their condition can stabilize after months to years of progression. Those with Stiff Limb syndrome have a poorer prognosis, as they do not respond well to medications. These patients often require a wheelchair. Prognosis is variable from person to person.[]","

CR_ENG_176,English,"A 30-year-old lady underwent an open abdominal hysterectomy. Six months later, she presented with right flank pain and was diagnosed to have a mid-ureteric stricture. A Boari flap repair was performed with insertion of a DJ stent. In view of persistent flank pain and urinary infection 6 weeks after the repair, computed tomography (CT) urography was performed. To the surprise of the treating urologist, the CT showed that the stent had traversed through the Boari flap and entered the IVC, with the upper coil of the stent in the supra-renal IVC []. The lower end of the stent was well placed in the bladder. There was no retroperitoneal hematoma. Further, the normal upper ureter was not connected to the Boari flap but was in continuation with the lower ureter []. The Boari flap, unconnected to the upper ureter, appeared like an out-pouching from the bladder.
At this stage, the patient was referred to our center for further management. After discussion with the patient, it was planned to remove the stent cystoscopically with a vascular team on standby. Surgical readiness was kept for exploration in the event of bleeding from the IVC. Reassessment of the stricture was planned after the stent was managed. The stent was removed cystoscopically with no complications. The stricture was subsequently managed by endoureterotomy and a stent was placed in the normal ureter. Two months after stent removal, the patient is doing well.","

CR_ENG_177,English,"A previously well forty-six-year old Caucasian man presented with exertional dyspnoea and two cutaneous nodules on his left wrist which were biopsied and confirmed as sarcoid nodules.
He was referred to the respiratory physicians for further investigations. Chest X-ray showed classical changes of pulmonary sarcoidosis, and serum ACE was mildly elevated at 92 U/L. He also described episodes of palpitation on exertion, ankle oedema, and progressively worsening breathlessness. However, the extent of his dyspnoea seemed disproportionate to that of his pulmonary involvement. An electrocardiogram (ECG) showed sinus rhythm with a prolonged PR interval (210 milliseconds), right bundle branch block, and left anterior fascicular block.
Based on his clinical presentation and ECG abnormalities, heart failure secondary to cardiac sarcoidosis was suspected and he was referred to the cardiology department.
Twenty-four-hour ambulatory monitoring showed sinus rhythm though out with short runs of sinus tachycardia. Serum brain-natriuretic peptide (BNP) level was unremarkable at 21.3 pg/mL (normally less than 50 pg/mL). Percutaneous coronary angiography demonstrated normal coronary arteries, and endomyocardial biopsy showed “mild” and “nonspecific changes,” failing to confirm sarcoid infiltration.
A CMR scan was subsequently performed to further examine the LV systolic function and assess for myocardial sarcoid infiltration. The left ventricle (LV) was nondilated and demonstrated moderate impairment of LV systolic function (ejection fraction 39%) associated with an akinetic but nonthinned interventricular septum. The right ventricular systolic function was also significantly impaired. Late gadolinium enhancement imaging showed several areas of myocardial hyperenhancement involving the anteroseptal subendocardium, subepicardium, and basal lateral epicardium.
The patient was initially treated with high-dose oral prednisolone therapy (40 mg/day) and referred to the tertiary heart failure centre. Following treatment, twelve lead ECG abnormalities improved with the only residual abnormality being right bundle branch block.
A second CMR scan was carried out 42 days after the initiation of his steroid therapy and showed marked improvement in right and left ventricular systolic function. Despite this, the areas of hyperenhancement seen in the first CMR scan remained. In addition, the RV surface of the inferior interventricular septum and RV free wall also appeared affected ().","

CR_ENG_178,English,"Case 2: A 48-year-old CMV-IgG- and IgM-negative female received a KTx from a deceased CMV-IgG-positive donor. Shortly after transplantation, the patient was treated with anti-thymocyte globulin and immunoadsorption due to the acute rejection. As the patient had shown progressive leukopenia after KTx even before rejection therapy, VGC therapy was discontinued and CMV PCR was monitored weekly. In the further course, leukopenia normalized and prophylactic therapy with VGC was re-initiated but had to be paused after 3 days because of recurrent leucopenia. At week 6 post-KTx, blood screening revealed a positive CMV PCR. The recurrence of leukopenia after initiation of therapeutic VGC therapy led to the decision of changing therapy to LMV (480 mg once daily) and to pause VGC therapy. Stable CMV clearance was gained after 42 days of therapy (two negative PCR tests within two weeks). Therapy was switched back to prophylactic VGC (450 mg/d, adapted to eGFR). One hundred and ninety-one days post-KTx, PCR testing for CMV DNA revealed 77,000 copies, and the patient presented with diarrhea as a clinical symptom of CMV-associated colitis. Due to severe leukopenia, VGC therapy was discontinued, and CMV IVIg therapy was instituted (100 IE/kg body weight); however, the viral load increased to >1,000,000 copies in a few days. Consequently, the patient was hospitalized, immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) was stopped, and additional treatment with intravenous GCV initiated. Because of the life-threatening clinical situation, rising CMV levels and weak CMV T-cell reactivity by ELISPOT, LMV was introduced again as an add-on therapy. The resistance analysis of CMV against VGC/GCV was negative. A triple combination therapy led to a rapid decrease in CMV viremia. GCV was replaced by oral VGC, but VGC treatment again resulted in leukopenia. Under current medication, consisting of LMV (480 mg) and CMV-IVIg, sustained clearance of CMV viremia was achieved. LMV therapy is continued to date (b).","

CR_ENG_181,English,"A 40-year-old woman with end-stage hypertrophic cardiomyopathy underwent heart transplantation following LV assist device support. She also had several events of epileptic seizures due to a previous cerebrovascular disease.
The donor, who was in her sixties, was brain-dead due to severe hypoxic encephalopathy during cardiac arrest. After resuscitation, electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST-segment elevation in leads II, III, and aVF (Figure
). Cardiac catheterization showed hyperkinesis of the LV base and akinesia of the apex without coronary artery stenosis (Figure
). Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) demonstrated apical ballooning on the initial assessment, which improved during donor management with intra-aortic balloon pumping support. Intra-aortic balloon pumping was successfully weaned 2 days before procurement. Before the procurement (7 days after cardiac arrest), LV dysfunction normalized, leading to the diagnosis of TTS. Cardiac arrest was considered to be due to TTS, and the haemodynamic derangement was considered to be temporary, which suggested the validity of the donor candidate for heart transplantation.
The recipient received the marginal donor heart because of haemodynamic instability due to aortic insufficiency under LV assist device support and underwent orthotopic heart transplantation using the modified bicaval technique. Within 6 months after heart transplantation, there was no overt problem in the transplanted heart. However, she was admitted three times for epileptic seizures, and her epilepsy was controlled with antiepileptic drugs (i.e. levetiracetam and zonisamide).
Nine months after the last episode of epileptic seizure, she was readmitted for epileptic seizure recurrence. On admission, her heart rate was 135 beats/min, and her blood pressure was 140/100 mmHg. Endotracheal intubation was performed to maintain the airway. ECG revealed sinus tachycardia with right bundle branch block (Figure
).
On the next day, ECG revealed T-wave inversion in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6 (Figure
). High-sensitivity troponin I was 1872.1 pg/mL (normal, <26.2 pg/mL), and brain natriuretic peptide was 1005.7 pg/mL (normal, <18.4 pg/mL). TTE demonstrated apical ballooning (Figure
). We calculated the InterTAK diagnostic score value of 59 points and suspected TTS rather than acute coronary syndrome.
Dobutamine was administered at a rate of 2.8 μg/kg/min, and intravenous furosemide was used for heart failure treatment. Successful extubation was achieved on Day 2. Repeated TTE showed a gradual improvement in LV contraction, and dobutamine administration was discontinued on Day 4.
Coronary angiography showed no significant stenosis (Figure
). Right ventricular endomyocardial biopsy showed partial fibrosis, sparse lymphocyte infiltration, and hemosiderin deposition, which were considered as artefacts due to injury evoked by previous biopsies. There were no findings suggesting acute cellular or antibody-mediated rejection. On Day 18, TTE revealed recovery of LV dysfunction (Figure
), confirming the diagnosis of TTS triggered by epileptic seizures. On Day 49, iodine-123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) imaging demonstrated uptake reduction in the inferior–posterior, lateral, and apex regions (Figure
). The heart-to-mediastinum ratios in the early and delayed phases were 1.55 and 1.25, respectively. The total washout rate was 39.0%, and in the apical region, it was >40%. The patient was discharged on Day 63 with stable condition.","

CR_ENG_182,English,"A 33-year-old male with a history of HIV/AIDS presented to the emergency department with intermittent right upper quadrant abdominal pain, fevers, hematemesis and melena for several weeks. Vitals showed a temperature of 37.1 °C, heart rate of 148, respiratory rate of 16, blood pressure of 111/63, and oxygen saturation of 100% on room air. Physical exam revealed a thin male in no apparent distress. His exam was unremarkable aside from tachycardia with a regular rhythm on cardiac exam. Pertinent negatives included a benign abdominal exam and absence of any significant lymphadenopathy or dermatologic findings. Laboratories were notable for a hemoglobin of 6.5 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 86.1 fL, and platelet count of 6,000 with an otherwise unremarkable differential, LDH of 185 U/L, ESR of 34 MM, CRP of 6.58 mg/dL, absolute CD4 count of 41 CMM, and a positive EIA and Hemoccult for stool occult blood.
An esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) was performed which revealed a large gastric antral mass that was biopsied () as well as multiple bleeding Dieulafoy lesions in the gastric fundus that were subsequently hemoclipped. The biopsy report showed clusters of large, monomorphic, malignant lymphoid cells with 1). positive staining for CD3, CD4, CD8, and MUM-1; 2). a high proliferation rate (95%) by Ki-67; and 3). negative staining for CD10, CD20, CD30, CD56, EBER, ALK-1, and TIA-1. These findings were consistent with peripheral T-cell lymphoma but excluded the diagnosis of ALK-1 positive and negative anaplastic large cell lymphoma, extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, and cytotoxic T-cell lymphoma. A staging CT scan showed an approximately 2 × 1.9 cm soft-tissue mass inseparable from the right psoas but without any significant mediastinal, hilar, or axillary lymphadenopathy. The remainder of his staging work-up including bone marrow biopsy, CSF, and further imaging would return negative for involvement by lymphoma.
The patient would complete 6-cycles of EPOCH (etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin) and intrathecal (IT) methotrexate. A surveillance PET-CT would later show metabolic activity consistent with treatment effect on the bone marrow but otherwise absence of activity to suggest recurrence of lymphoma. The patient would later return with right lower extremity/lower back radiculopathy and left upper extremity swelling with an approximate 4 × 7 cm area of erythema that was tender and warm to palpation.
Laboratories were notable for an absolute CD4 count of 23 CMM and HIV viral load of 76,000 copies/mL despite having been on antiretroviral therapy since his HIV diagnosis 4 years earlier. Subcutaneous tissue biopsy of the left triceps showed clusters of large malignant lymphoid cells with staining characteristics consistent with PTCL as before. A repeat staging CT scan showed a 3.4 × 2.1 cm L5-level mass posterior to the right psoas. An MRI of the brain would show bilateral signal enhancement within the lateral subthalamus, midbrain, and internal capsule (). CSF analysis would show the presence of atypical lymphoid cells suspicious for lymphoma. Bone marrow biopsy, however, would show an absence of involvement by lymphoma.
The patient subsequently received high-dose intravenous (IV) methotrexate (8 g/m2) for his relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma (stage IV) that originally manifested as a gastric mass. Due to extremely poor elimination following the methotrexate administration, he would instead complete 3 cycles of IV pemetrexed 900 mg/m2 (in 3-week cycles) that was well tolerated as he experienced only a grade I nausea as an adverse event. Subsequent restaging PET-CT and MRI of the brain would show a complete radiographic response (). At the time of this report, he is scheduled to undergo autologous stem cell transplantation in the setting of his second complete remission.","

CR_ENG_183,English,"A 55-year-old woman with a medical history of smoking and peripheral artery disease treated by aspirin was diagnosed with ulcerated acrolentiginous melanoma of the right foot (Breslow 2.1 mm). There was no suspect metabolism highlighted by the PET scan. However, the resected sentinel lymph node proved positive for metastatic cells. Therefore, nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks was introduced as adjuvant treatment on May 2019 (day 0).
Before treatment initiation, hemoglobin level was measured at 12.7 g/dL and remained unchanged within the first month of treatment. Two months after nivolumab initiation though, on day 55, hemoglobin level which was 11.8 g/dL, suddenly dropped to 7.2 g/dL on day 84. In the meantime, platelet count dropped to 108 G/L then 93 G/L on day 86 before returning to normal on day 128. Transient and moderate leukopenia at 1.5 G/L also occurred on day 86. The patient was first transfused with 2 packs of red blood cells (PRBCs) followed by transfusions twice a week thereafter. Despite a total of 29 PRBCs with a nadir at 4.3 g/dL and a thorough workup to find a source of bleeding, hemoglobin level remained persistently low ().
The patient presented a non-regenerative anemia with a low reticulocytes count. No iron, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency was identified. Haptoglobin level dropped on day 119 and bilirubin level was at some point slightly supranormal. Direct Coombs test turned out to be positive for IgG and C3. Parvovirus B19 serology was found negative. EBV and CMV serologies were consistent with past infections. Hemocultures were negative. There were no paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria clones. The complement and its fractions were normal. Anti-DNA antibodies were negative. There was no suspect lesion identified at the 18-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) planned exam, but only a diffuse reactional osteomedullary hypermetabolism. Two bone marrow examinations were remarkable for the lack of erythroblastic cell line, without dysplasia or abnormal cells. These findings were consistent with PRCA.
Nivolumab was withdrawn on day 98 after the 8th cycle, and oral corticosteroid treatment was initiated on day 135 (60 mg a day) without efficacy (). PRCA persisted and the patient remained transfusions-dependent for almost two more months. On day 184, intravenous cyclosporin was introduced at 3 mg/kg with PRBC transfusion. Cyclosporin was dramatically effective with a hemoglobin level rising to 9 g/dL on the 3rd day and reticulocytes count at 1,246,932/mm3. Two weeks after cyclosporin introduction, on day 198, hemoglobin concentration returned to pre-nivolumab levels at 11.7 g/dL. The patient was discharged with oral cyclosporin treatment at 80 mg twice a day (day 278) and corticosteroids both with a slow taper until March 2020. Cyclosporin was first tapered in January (70 mg twice a day) then every 7 to 10 days until March 2020. Corticosteroids were tapered every month between October 2019 and March 2020. On January 2020 (day 226), hemoglobin level was 14.4 g/dL. Nine months after nivolumab withdrawal, there was no PRCA relapse and the patient remained free of melanoma progression without any cancer treatment.","

CR_ENG_184,English,"A 37-year-old female presented to the emergency department complaining of headache for 20 days. Major symptoms were paroxysmal pain and irregular onset, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. Physical examination showed no positive signs except for a positive Romberg sign. Laboratory tests were negative. Cranial enhanced MRI showed there was a circular abnormal signal at the posterior margin of the foramen magnum, with clear boundary and a size of about 2.5 cm × 1.9 cm × 2.6 cm. After the enhanced scan, the signal was significantly enhanced. This mass compressed the dorsal medulla oblongata and was closely related to the spinal cord. The supplying artery was the posterior inferior cerebellar artery. We suspected a schwannoma or ependymoma. In order to improve the patient's clinical symptoms and obtain an accurate diagnosis, the patient underwent occipital craniotomy through the posterior median approach. During the operation, the posterior occipital bone and C1 posterior arch were opened, and the dural membrane was incised in a y-shaped manner. The tumor was found to be located below the cerebellar tonsils at the posterior margin of the foramen magnum. It was closely related to the right posterior inferior cerebellar artery, with clear boundary and soft texture. The tumor was removed completely and sent for pathological examination. After the operation, the patient's vital signs were stable. Consciousness was clear and no abnormal signs were found. Cranial enhanced MRI re-examination on the second day after surgery showed complete resection of the tumor (Fig. ). Pathological results showed metastatic NE carcinoma of the brain, the Ki67 value-added index was as high as 95%. Immunohistochemistry showed that AE1/AE3, CD56, CK8/18, EMA, Syn, and TTf-1 were positive, while CD34, CgA, CK7, GFAP, Nestin, NeuN, S-100, and Vim were negative (Fig. ). Whole body PET-CT examination showed that fusiform soft tissue shadows with a size of about 43 mm × 22 mm × 32 mm could be seen near the hilum of the lower lobe of the left lung (Fig. ). After consultation with the department of respiratory and oncology, Bronchoscopic lung biopsy was performed and the final pathological results indicated the LCNEC of the lung.

CR_ENG_185,English,"A 78-year-old male with a known infrarenal AAA presented with recent left flank pain at the Urology Department of Severance Hospital. The patient had previously undergone a percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty at the mid right coronary artery (RCA) due to inferior wall myocardial infarction 22 years ago and had been regularly followed up. In addition, he also had a past history of hypercholesterolemia and benign prostate hyperplasia. He reported being a non-smoker without hypertension or diabetes. The AAA was incidentally discovered on coronary computed tomography (CT) taken six years ago and had a maximal diameter of 33 mm.
The CT taken prior to admission demonstrated a thrombosed infrarenal aortic aneurysm with an increased maximum diameter of 63 mm, which prompted a referral to Cardiology (). The proximal aortic neck had an angulation of approximately 45° to the suprarenal aorta, and the length of the aortic neck to the right renal artery orifice was 16 mm. However, the left renal artery orifice was adjacent to the aneurysm, and there was practically no neck. Therefore, if the conventional EVAR technique were to be used, the blood flow to the left renal artery would be compromised due to the stent, inevitably resulting in decreased renal function.
Based on the patient's advancing age and history of myocardial infarction, a preprocedural coronary evaluation was performed. An electrocardiogram showed normal sinus rhythm with ischemic changes in inferior leads, and echocardiography showed reduced left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 48% and akinesia of the RCA territory. The coronary angiography showed significant tandem stenotic lesions of the proximal and distal left anterior descending artery, which were subsequently treated with drug-eluting stents (Endeavor Sprint 3.0×24 mm and 2.5×18 mm, Medtronic, Santa Rosa, CA, USA).
Considering the patient's age and history of significant coronary artery disease, we decided to perform EVAR using the chimney technique for AAA during his hospital stay.
Vascular access in both femoral arteries was obtained percutaneously and was preclosed using two suture type closure devices (ProGlide, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL, USA) on each side. A 7 Fr Shuttle Sheath was inserted into the suprarenal aorta through the left brachial artery access. The left renal artery was cannulated using a 5 Fr Multi-purpose catheter through the Shuttle Sheath. A 0.035"" wire (Amplatz stiff wire Cook Medical Inc., Bloomington, IN, USA) was inserted into the left renal artery, and a 6×50 mm graft stent (Viabahn, Gore, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) was placed into the left renal artery along the wire.
A 36×70 mm aortic extension stent graft (Endurant, Medtronic) was inserted into the abdominal aorta through the right femoral artery and deployed so that the upper end of the graft of the aortic extension is positioned just below the right renal artery. The ostium of the left renal artery was covered by the graft (). Subsequently, the Viabahn stent graft (Gore Viabahn Endoprothesis, W.L. Gore and Associates, Flagstaff, AZ, USA) placed in the left renal artery was deployed. Thereafter, a 36-20-166 mm bifurcated Endurant main body stent was inserted into the abdominal aorta through the left femoral artery and deployed in overlap with the aortic extension (). Also, a 16-24-93 mm contralateral limb piece (Endurant, Medtronic) was inserted through the right femoral artery and deployed.
The apposition of the aortic extension and the Viabahn stent graft to the aortic wall was achieved by a kissing balloon method using a 46 mm Reliant balloon and a 6×40 mm peripheral angioplasty balloon (). Immediate post-procedure angiography showed no significant endoleak and patent left renal artery (). The left brachial artery access site was manually compressed and the femoral puncture sites were closed by tightening the prepared sutures.
No endoleaks or other complications were noted on routine postprocedural follow-up CT (). The laboratory results showed the patient's creatinine level at 1.14 mg/dL, which had no interval change of creatinine (baseline creatine 1.2 to 1.4 mg/dL) and estimated glomerular filtration rate.
The patient developed a fever after the procedure, but with no evident leukocytosis and negative blood culture, it was considered as a post-implant syndrome. The patient was discharged without other significant complications.","

CR_ENG_187,English,"A 24-year-old female, who is a known case of epilepsy, was admitted to the burn unit under dermatology and internal medicine care, with severe dehydration and painful erythematous macular rash involving around 25-30% of her body including the face, all of which started 10 days after switching her anti-convulsant therapy to Keppra (Levetiracetam). The patient was diagnosed with SJS-TEN overlap and was treated with intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone 500 mg once per day for the first two days, followed by oral dexamethasone 0.5 mg four times daily from day 3 until day 5, in addition to systemic cyclosporine A at a dose of 150 mg per day (equivalent to 3.75 mg/kg/day), which continued until day 10. The patient also received subcutaneous (SC) etanercept 50 mg on day 2 of admission.
Ophthalmology consultation was requested to address her severe bilateral eye pain, inability to open the eyes, and poor visual acuity. On examination, there was severe upper and lower eyelid edema with epidermal sloughing, severe congestion, chemosis, and hemorrhagic conjunctival membranes in both eyes. Examination using portable slit-lamp and fluorescein staining also showed total corneal and conjunctival epithelial defects affecting the bulbar and palpebral conjunctiva in the right eye, and 50% corneal epithelial defect with palpebral conjunctival epithelial defects in the left eye. Visual acuity could not be assessed as the patient was unable to open her eyes.
The patient was unfit for local or general anaesthesia to undergo a full ocular surface AMT, thus, the decision was made to apply a ProKera® device to both eyes, after thorough irrigation and removal of conjunctival membranes.
Intensive one-hourly preservative-free lubricating eye drops (sodium hyaluronate 0.2%) were also initiated, in addition to prednisolone acetate 1% drops four times daily, moxifloxacin 0.5% drops four times daily, combined with daily sweeping of the fornices and lid margins to prevent symblepharon and/or ankyloblepharon formation.
On day 10, both ProKera® devices were removed to reassess the ocular surface. External examination showed significant improvement with much less congestion in the left eye (Figure ). Slit-lamp examination revealed that the right eye still has 30% corneal epithelial defect with small areas of conjunctival epithelial defects inferiorly (Figure ), and the ProKera® device was reapplied. The left eye showed complete conjunctival re-epithelialization with small corneal epithelial defect and diffuse multiple superficial punctate keratopathies (SPKs) (Figure ). A bandage contact lens (BCL) was applied to this eye for the patient’s comfort. The patient also reported improvement of symptoms and visual acuity at the time of examination was 6/120 in the right eye, and 6/36 in the left eye.
On day 14, the patient’s systemic condition was stable, with complete skin re-epithelialization. Ophthalmic examination showed a visual acuity of 6/60 in the right eye and 6/36 in the left eye. Complete corneal and conjunctival re-epithelialization was also achieved in both eyes with diffuse SPKs, and the patient was discharged on BCL in both eyes, intensive lubrication, prednisolone acetate 1% four times daily (to be tapered weekly), cyclosporine-A 0.05% four times daily, and prophylactic moxifloxacin 0.5% twice daily.
The patient was followed up weekly, and her symptoms were improving gradually. Uncorrected visual acuity improved to 6/12 in both eyes, with minimal congestion and few SPKs. BCLs were discontinued uneventfully after two weeks (day 28) and prednisolone acetate 1% was switched to fluorometholone 0.1% (three times daily initially with weekly tapering) and lubricating ointment was also added to her regimen.
However, the patient presented three weeks later with worsening of her symptoms and decreased visual acuity to 6/18 in the right eye and 6/24 in the left eye. Examination revealed early lid margin keratinization, partial ankyloblepharon, and diffuse SPKs in both eyes (Figures -). Adhesions were separated, and the patient was restarted on prednisolone acetate 1% eye drops in addition to Maxitrol ointment (Neomycin, Polymyxin B, and Dexamethasone 0.1%). BCLs were also applied to both eyes.
After discussing systemic treatment options with the patient, the decision was made to start intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy for four cycles over four months (2 g/kg/cycle given over two days), with the possibility to extend treatment to six cycles if the favorable response is achieved.
The patient noticed an improvement in her symptoms after the second cycle, with significant improvement of ocular surface wetness, and visual acuity of 6/12 in the right eye and 6/18 in the left eye, and BCLs were discontinued. Both Maxitrol ointment and prednisolone acetate drops were also discontinued after two cycles of IVIG, and the patient was kept on lubricating eye drops (sodium hyaluronate 0.2%) and ointments, fluorometholone 0.1% eye drops with slow tapering and cyclosporine 0.05% for the remainder of the treatment plan. IVIG therapy was continued for a total of six cycles.
After six cycles, the patient’s symptoms further improved and on her last visit to the clinic, she achieved visual acuity of 6/9 in both eyes. Her examination showed quiet eyes and a wet ocular surface with only a few SPKs (Figure ). No new symblepharon or ankyloblepharon formation was noted. The lid margin anatomy and irregularity improved significantly. However, signs of meibomian gland dysfunction and keratinization are still present (Figure ). The patient still has symptoms of dry eyes that are currently being managed sufficiently with lubricating eye drops and ointments.","

CR_ENG_188,English,"During mid-April 2020, a 39-year-old woman with previous medical history of hypertension controlled with medication, type 2 diabetes mellitus of recent diagnosis controlled with medication, and cholecystectomy (6 years ago) was admitted to a teaching hospital in Barranquilla, Colombia, and presented with symptoms of progressive generalised weakness for 6 days, predominantly involving the lower limbs. Twenty days prior to admission, she had an episode of illness consisting of ageusia, anosmia and intense headache for which she had multiple consultations without improvement of the symptoms. She also complained of intense myalgias and symmetric, ascendant and generalised weakness in the lower limbs, which gradually progressed to inability to walk for which she was referred to our hospital. Upon admission, the patient reported symptoms of headache, malaise, generalised myalgias, cough without expectoration and inability to walk. Her blood pressure on sitting was 167/88 mmHg, heart rate was regular (74 beats per min), respiratory rate was 18 breaths per min (bpm) and SaO2 was 95% on room air. Based on her neurological examination, she was found to have peripheral facial diplegia, generalised hyporeflexia, generalised quadriparesis with lower limb predominance, Medical Research Council (MRC) muscular strength of 2/5 in the lower limbs and 4/5 in the upper limbs. She also had left arm paraesthesia. No affectation was observed in the bulbar muscles. During the clinical evolution she had generalised flaccid areflexia. She was later shifted to the intensive care unit due to hypertensive emergency (189/112 mmHg), and progressive diaphragmatic weakness with 36 bpm, without breath sounds in auscultation, which could indicate dysautonomic symptoms. Table shows the results of the initial laboratory tests indicating leukocytosis, neutrophilia (79.90%, with a neutrophil-lymphocyte ratio of 16.27), lactate dehydrogenase and elevated D-Dimer levels. Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) levels were normal. The cerebrospinal fluid analysis revealed protein cytological dissociation (298.3/0.05). Elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein is a hallmark of GBS. The chest X-ray and chest CT scan (128-slice SOMATOM, Siemens, GE) were normal. A nerve conduction and electromyography test (Table ) confirmed the clinical evaluation of the GBS diagnosis. The MRI showed an incipient degenerative cervical disc disease at the C5-C6 level, normal thoracic spine, a Pfirrmann IV degenerative lumbar disc disease with central protrusions and flavum ligamentum hypertrophy at levels L3-L4, L4-L5 and L5-S1, which are not related with the clinical signs and symptoms of the patient.
The patient was managed with supportive care; administered with enoxaparin (40 mg SC per day), losartan (50 mg BID), meperidine IV for muscle pain, hydroxychloroquine (400 mg twice first day and later on 200 mg BID per 10 days) and dexamethasone (8 mg every 8 h during 3 days); and received standard care. She did not require supplemental oxygen or ventilation, and no alterations were observed in the chest images. She also received plasmapheresis for 5 days, one session per day. After three sessions, the patient had neurological improvement, (MRC) muscular strength of 3/5 in the lower limbs, and improved respiratory rate (20 bpm). During the hospitalization, the patient underwent two nasal swab tests for SARS-CoV-2. The first RT-PCR test (Charité/Berlin Protocol) for SARS-CoV-2 was negative, whereas the second RT-PCR test (Charité/Berlin Protocol) for SARS-CoV-2 was positive. She was discharged after 20 days of hospitalisation with improvement of neurological status (MRC of 4/5 in the lower limbs) and respiratory symptoms.","

CT of the orbit showed a 4.5 cm × 1.3 cm ill-defined soft tissue mass of the lower medial wall of the right orbit with the destruction of the medial wall of the orbit and extending into right ethmoid air cells with no involvement of the optic nerve. Incision biopsy of the mass showed an adenocarcinoma (Figures , ) that was positive for cytokeratin (CK)7 staining (Figure ). Immunostain for thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) (Figure ), S100, and CK20 (Figure ) was negative.
CT scans of the chest/abdomen/pelvis with and without contrast were negative for evidence of any chest malignancy. No intra-abdominal or hepatic masses, bone lesions, or intra-abdominal adenopathy were observed. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) showed positive activity in the lower eyelid region and slight activity in the right submandibular nodal region. MRI of the orbits was significant for an enhancing infiltrative mass extending from the inferior right periorbital region to the medial canthus and posteriorly into the orbit, as well as the right ethmoid sinuses. The mass was infiltrating the extraconal fat within the orbit but without infiltration of the right optic nerve or retrobulbar fat (Figures , ).
The patient was transferred to a tertiary care center where he was scheduled for a right eye enucleation and right neck node sample. Due to extensive local invasion of the tumor, the patient underwent an extensive surgery that included right maxillectomy with orbital exenteration, right total ethmoidectomy, right sphenoidotomy, right frontal sinusotomy with the removal of the anterior table of the frontal sinus, skull base resection, and right selective neck dissection levels 1 through 4. The patient underwent a reconstruction of the skull base. Operative biopsy was conclusive of a high-grade apocrine adenocarcinoma (3.7 cm) extensively involving the infraorbital dermis and subcutaneous tissue, sinonasal mucosa (both maxillary and ethmoid sinuses), periorbital soft tissue with extensive lymphatic invasion including dermal lymphatics, optic nerve, and bone margins were negative. Selective neck dissection was positive for a metastatic adenocarcinoma (3.5 cm) in one of the right jugulodigastric nodes, metastatic adenocarcinoma (2.5 cm) in two of the level 1B nodes. Metastatic adenocarcinoma of right neck level 3 (0.5 cm) in two nodes, level 2 (1.1 cm in six of twelve nodes and level 4 dissection (1.1) in twelve of twenty-four lymph nodes. The skull base margin was also invaded by malignant cells. Given the aggressive tumor pathology and natural history, the patient was a candidate for adjuvant radiotherapy. He received intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) to maximize the coverage of the target tissues and minimize dose to the surrounding critical structure. Daily cone-beam computed tomography (CT) was used to ensure accurate daily localization. Given several high-risk factors including positive margin, several metastatic lymph nodes, and extensive lymphatic invasion, the patient was started on weekly cisplatin. The patient completed a course of 66 Gy in 33 fractions of adjuvant IMRT along with six cycles of cisplatin. He is scheduled for a follow-up MRI of the skull base and PET/CT in three months.","

CR_ENG_191,English,"The patient was a 68-year-old male referred by his general practitioner (GP) for a soft-tissue ultrasound scan of his left thigh. He presented with a 3-month history of a left thigh lump following trauma. The patient described walking into a corner of a table with bruising and a lump. The bruising had disappeared, although the lump had persisted. The lump was not increasing in size or painful.
The ultrasound scan showed a well-defined and ovoid hypoechoic abnormality in the subcutaneous tissues containing internal echoes [Figures and ]. There was no internal Doppler flow, and this was compressible to probe palpation. Given the history of trauma, the appearances could represent a haematoma, although a repeat ultrasound scan was advised in 6 weeks to assess for resolution. The repeat ultrasound scan after 6 weeks showed no interim changes of the abnormality and was reported as a haematoma [Figures and ].
The patient presented back to their GP 8 months following the last ultrasound scan as the lump had increased in size and painful with no new injury or history of anticoagulation. The patient was referred for another soft-tissue ultrasound scan showing an irregular and complex abnormality with marked internal Doppler flow [Figures and ].

CR_ENG_194,English,"A 13-year-old female patient was presented for consultation to the Department of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics, School of Dentistry, Lebanese University. Her chief complaint was the crowding of her anterior teeth. Her medical and dental histories were noncontributory, and the patient did not mention any previous or recent habit. On physical examination, no swelling or tenderness was documented.
Upon clinical examination, the patient had all her permanent teeth and a retained mandibular left second primary molar. Radiographic records consisted of an orthopantomogram, a lateral cephalogram, a posteroanterior cephalogram, and a hand wrist radiograph. The orthopantomogram revealed a well-defined radiolucent lesion on the mandibular left side surrounding the unerupted mandibular left second premolar which appeared to be mesially tipped below the retained primary second molar. The root of the adjacent premolar was included in the lesion but did not reveal any root resorption (Figures and ).
Going back to the old orthopantomogram (OPG) of the patient collected by the Pediatrics Department, it was noted that no lesion was visible at that time (). The patient was referred to the Oral Pathology Department in order to obtain a meticulous diagnosis concerning the radiolucent lesion that was detected on the orthopantomogram during the initial diagnosis. The differential diagnosis for the lesion included a DC, an odontogenic keratocyst, and an ameloblastoma. Histologically, a thick epithelial lining with rete ridges was present. Moreover, chronic inflammatory cellular infiltration appeared in the capsule of the cyst. All these findings confirmed that the diagnosed cyst is a DC. The major objective of initiating the treatment as early as possible in this patient was to hinder the progression of the DC prohibiting its destructive consequences. Moreover, the aim of initiating a nonaggressive (marsupialization) treatment was to save the involved tooth, allowing its healthy eruption.
Several treatment modalities of a DC have been reported in the literature ranging from marsupialization to enucleation. The common treatment for DC is enucleation followed by extraction of the involved tooth. When the cyst is large, the first approach is marsupialization to decrease the size of the osseous defect and then enucleation and tooth extraction are performed afterwards [–].
Enucleation is the chosen treatment plan whenever the cyst is small and saving the involved tooth is impossible. This treatment modality should be avoided in large cysts since it is usually accompanied by facial, esthetic, and functional defects [].
Other approaches are considered when the cyst is small and when the patient is young. In cases of enlarged follicles of impacted canines, exposing the affected tooth surgically and the traction of the tooth by orthodontic means leads to the cessation of the cystic lesion and the preservation of the affected tooth [].
Taking into consideration that the diagnosed cyst can potentially become an aggressive lesion with a bone destructive ability that might lead to loss of the involved teeth, root resorption, pain, and facial asymmetry, and considering the age of the patient, a primary approach by marsupialization was initiated ().
After the surgery, the patient was instructed to wear the acrylic resin obturator that was previously fabricated to maintain the surgical opening during healing and assure success of the surgery (). The patient was asked to eat with the obturator in place and remove it only for cleaning. Follow-up appointments were scheduled every three months postsurgery to assure the eruption of the second premolar and the absence of any recurrence.
The postsurgical orthopantomogram (OPG) that was taken 6 months after the surgery revealed the absence of any radiolucent lesion and the successful eruption of the mandibular left second premolar (Figures and ).","

CR_ENG_195,English,"A 56 year old male patient reported to the department of Oral & Maxillofacial Prosthetics, Manipal College of Dental Sciences, Mangalore, India, with a chief complaint of abnormal speech pattern and difficulty in mastication. Patient gave a history of hearing impairment for which he had consulted an otolaryngologist, and was diagnosed as a case of cleft palate which was subsequently corrected surgically eighteen years ago. The patient used a hearing aid and his speech was hypernasal. Clinical examination revealed a scar tissue present in the uvular region with incompetent soft palate and a bifid uvula () which did not meet the nasopharynx on swallowing. The mandibular arch was completely edentulous while maxillary arch had both the premolars and first molar missing on the right side and the first and second molars missing on the left side (Kennedy's class II modification I). After careful examination a combination of prosthetic rehabilitation and speech therapy was planned for the patient.
The treatment started with counseling the patient about the nature, function, and limitations of the prosthesis and making him aware about the importance of periodic follow-up. A preliminary impression was made with alginate (Zelgan, Dentsply, Constance, Germany) using modified stock trays and a diagnostic cast was prepared with Type III dental stone (Gypstone, Prevest Denpro Ltd, Jammu, India). Border molding of edentulous area was done with low fusing compound (Pinnacle tracing sticks, DPI, Mumbai, India) and the soft palate was recorded in a superiorly displaced position using impression compound (Pinnacle, DPI, Mumbai, India). The secondary impression was then made using addition polysilicone (Reprosil, Dentsply, Milford, USA) and definitive cast was prepared with Type IV dental stone (Kalrock, Kalabhai Karson Pvt. Ltd, Mumbai, India). Simultaneously mandibular border molding was done and final impression was made using zinc oxide eugenol (Neogenate, Septodont, Delhi, India) by conventional method.
Initially, an edentulous interim palatal plate with palatal lift extension () was fabricated using heat cure acrylic resin (DPI Heat Cure, DPI, Mumbai, India) and was given to the patient for a period of one month. This was done with the purpose of getting the patient accustomed to the feel of the prosthesis and the pressure exerted by the palatal extensions. After one month bite registration was done using bite registration paste (Reprosil, Dentsply, Milford, USA) and a new interim acrylic palatal lift prosthesis replacing the missing teeth along with lower complete denture () having balanced occlusal scheme was given to the patient for another two months. Patient was kept on periodic follow-up with this prosthesis. Simultaneously, the speech therapy was also started at the Department of Audiology, KMC, Attavara, and once the patient started showing satisfactory response the final cast partial palatal lift prosthesis was planned.
The diagnostic cast was surveyed and mouth preparation was done on maxillary teeth, the right and left canines, left premolars, and right second molar. Guide planes and rests seats were prepared using triangular configuration of support which is effective in neutralizing leverage. The final impression was now made by addition polyvinyl siloxane (Reprosil, Dentsply, Milford, USA) using the double mix single impression technique with rest seats being recorded by light body and remaining areas by regular body and master cast was prepared with Type IV dental stone. Metal frame work was designed to engage most of the remaining teeth to achieve additional retention and support and try-in was done in the patient's mouth (). Occlusal rims were fabricated and the maxillo-mandibular relation was recorded with adequate inter-occlusal free way space. The final prosthesis was then fabricated, finished and was inserted in the patient's mouth (). The patient was recalled for periodic follow-up. Audiometric analysis was periodically performed by a speech pathologist using the Temple Street Scale and change in the speech pattern was evident with the score, being reduced from pretreatment score of 3 (moderate hypernasality - evident on high and low vowels) to post insertion score of 2 (mild/moderate hypernasality - unacceptable distortion evident on high vowels). Further improvement in speech was observed one month after insertion of the prosthesis and regular sessions of speech therapy. The patient is currently under regular follow-up.","

CR_ENG_196,English,"A 56-year-old Caucasian male with past medical history of a high-grade astrocytoma of the right temporal lobe presented to the oncology clinic with dyspnea and palpitations for several weeks. He had been diagnosed with high-grade astrocytoma six months prior, which was treated with surgical resection and was followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiation for six weeks with temozolomide with subsequent maintenance temozolomide. Pathology from his original brain tumor noted mixed features of an anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) with atypical features versus glioblastoma. The pathologist described an astrocytic neoplasm composed of cells with variable polymorphism, brisk mitotic activity including atypical forms, and necrosis were present. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) stains were positive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), oligodendroglial lineage 2 (OLIG2) and cellular differentiation 34 marker (CD34). The tumor did not harbor isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH-1), methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or B-raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) mutations.
Upon presentation to our clinic, the patient was still receiving maintenance therapy with temozolomide 200 mg/m2 on days one through five every 28 days. On physical exam, he was found to be tachycardic with a heart rate in the 150s with an irregularly irregular rhythm. On physical exam, he was noted to have decreased breath sounds to auscultation on the right and dullness to percussion in the mid to lower right hemithorax. He was admitted to the hospital for further evaluation. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a pulmonary embolus in the left pulmonary artery in addition to a large pleural effusion on the right with pleural thickening and a nodular appearance. There was a new hypodense lesion in the superior part of the liver measuring 2.7 x 2.3 cm with multiple lytic bone lesions on CT of the abdomen. A bone scan confirmed the metastatic nature of bone lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed abnormal enhancement in the middle cranial fossa, which was thought to be related to prior treatment. Anti-coagulation with heparin was initiated for treatment of the pulmonary embolus. Thoracentesis revealed the effusion to be exudative and cytology was significant for atypical cells. Thoracoscopy was performed for pleural biopsy and on examination, classic pleural studding was noted (Figure ). Pleural biopsies were obtained using rigid optical forceps. Biopsy report showed malignant cells with initial IHC stains negative for calretinin, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cytokeratin 5/6 (CK 5/6), pankeratin, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1) and Wilms tumor protein (WT-1), as is usually done to rule out lung carcinoma or mesothelioma. Because of marked pleomorphism in the sample which is normally seen in glioblastoma or high grade astrocytomas, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) by IHC was checked and found to be positive. Additionally, S100 (acidic protein, which is a common marker for neural tissue and melanoma) by IHC was also positive (Figure ). Coupled together, these findings were consistent with metastasis from his known diagnosis of high grade astrocytoma/glioblastoma. The patient had placement of a PleurxTM catheter and was discharged home on anticoagulation therapy. Upon discharge and finalization of pathology report, the patient was offered chemotherapy with bevacizumab, but the patient opted to be placed in hospice and subsequently died a few weeks later.","

CR_ENG_197,English,"A 71-year-old woman with incomplete paraplegia L4 (conus cauda lesion, Asia D) due to a hernia nucleus pulposus L3-L4 underwent a laminectomy in 2010, complicated by two periods of postoperative bleeding. In April 2011, complaints of neuropathic pain in the legs worsened and subsequently an intradural cyst at L3-L4 developed, leading to a shift to the left of the cauda. Operation was not an option due to high risk of further loss of motor functions. In September 2012, the patient visited our Institute for Neuropathic Pain complaining of tingling, pins and needles, burning, and slight numbness in her legs. At the first visit she scored an 8 on the Douleur Neuropathique 4 (DN4) questionnaire, which supports that her pain was of neuropathic origin [].
Despite pharmacological treatments with pregabalin 450 mg, acetaminophen 3000 mg, and diclofenac 150 mg at the time of the first consultation, she scored the intensity of her pain as 6 on the 11-point numerical rating scale (NRS). In the past amitriptyline and gabapentin did not have sufficient effect. She could walk 60 minutes using a walking stick. Due to paresis of the foot extensors (MRC 4/5), the patient had reduced clearance while walking. There was also reduced stability and balance due to hip extensor weakness. We decided to add baclofen 5% cream applying 2 to 3 times daily on the neuropathic pain areas, as an analgesic from a different class could provide additional pain reduction. Oral baclofen was not used due to the risk of increasing muscle weakness. One month later the patient reported that tingling, pins and needles, and burning were completely vanished after application of the baclofen cream, without experiencing any side effects such as dizziness, drowsiness, and muscle weakness. However, she also reported that her quality of life changed in a surprisingly negative direction. She experienced more difficulties in walking and stumbled around leading to frequent falls, as she did not feel pain anymore and experienced considerably increased numbness of her legs. The absence of positive neuropathic symptoms and the concomitant surge of negative neuropathic symptoms in both her legs and feet apparently prevented her from being aware of her legs and feet and thus led to an increase in locomotor difficulties. Her steadier walking without stumbling and falling was more important for her than a reduction in neuropathic pain. Thus she decided to stop using baclofen cream, although this topical treatment evidently had a robust analgesic effect. After stopping the baclofen cream her previous complaints of tingling, pins and needles, burning, and slight numbness in her legs were as before.","

CR_ENG_198,English,"The patient is an eight-year-old boy who was referred to Hafez Hospital at Shiraz, Iran, in 2011. He was diagnosed with autism disorder according to the DSM- IV diagnostic criteria.[] There was marked limited verbal communication and skills, stereotypic behaviors, restricted interest, and a significant impairment in social relationships and interactions. He also displayed hyperactivity and inattentiveness in preschool. From two years ago, oral risperidone 2 mg/day and oral thioridazine 10 mg/day were administered, to control his hyperactivity and inattentiveness. No neurological or significant medical problems were found. His laboratory examination was unremarkable.
After a written informed consent form was provided by the parents, for participation of the child in a clinical trial (Irct registration number: IRCT201103023930N3), oral NAC 800 mg per day (Pharma Chimi, Iran) was added for management of his severe nail-biting behavior. There was a significant reduction in his nail-biting behavior. In addition, the parents noticed that there was a marked reduction in his autism symptoms 30 days after the onset of NAC administration. The visual analog scale showed that his social interaction was significantly increased and he responded to social interactions better than at the baseline. According to his parents’ report, the score of social impairment on the visual analog scale decreased from 10 to 6 in the two-month trial. The parents also reported that his verbal skills and communications increased from 5 to 9 after using the visual analog scale. The aggressive behaviors decreased from 10 to 3. His aggression toward his sister also significantly decreased. The parents had not marked a complaint about their children’s aggressive behavior on the last visit. In addition, his hyperactivity and limited interests were reduced after taking NAC. His preoccupation with a toy car was decreased and he was interested in playing with different toys. He had persuaded his parents to cut his hair every day before administration of NAC. They had to even cut his hair more than once a day. Now, his interest and persuasion to cut his hair was markedly deceased. Moreover, the severity and frequency of his blinking tic decreased. The parents did not report any side effect, except a mild abdominal pain. He had never experienced this type of significant improvement in the last few years, even after taking risperidone. They also reported that nothing worsened after the administration of NAC. He did not take any other antioxidant or glutathione prodrug during the period of study or for weeks before.","

CR_ENG_199,English,"A 6-month-old female patient was referred to plastic and oral and maxillofacial surgeons with a complaint of an expansile growth of the maxilla. The swelling was first noticed 2 months ago and slowly increased to the present size.
Clinical examination showed a normally developed female infant. On the anterior region of the maxilla, a firm nonulcerated reddish-blue tumor of about 4 cm × 3 cm was seen to be protruding through the lips and covered by the intact mucosa [].
The computed tomography (CT) scans of the head and neck region showed a tumor in the anterior maxilla region with a central hypodense area []. Results of routine laboratory investigations were within normal limits. The urine levels of vanillyl mandelic acid were elevated (6–9.5 mg).
Excisional biopsy of the tumor was undertaken.
The gross specimen received in the Department of Oral Pathology and Microbiology of Subharti Dental College comprised of a firm, well-circumscribed mass, measuring 4.5 cm × 3 cm × 2.5 cm. The cut surface was grayish-white in color with black pigmented areas [].
Microscopically, the tumor comprised of nests and clusters of tumor cells arranged in an alveolar pattern separated by fibrovascular stroma. The central part of the alveoli were made up of small and round cells with little cytoplasm and dark nuclei whereas the peripheral part comprised of cuboidal, flattened epitheloid cells containing melanin pigment in the cytoplasm [Figures and ]. Masson Fontana staining showed positivity for melanin in peripheral epitheloid cells []. With the above features, a diagnosis of primitive neuroectodermal tumor of infancy was made. IHC was advised for confirmation of the diagnosis. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed positive staining for HMB-45 in the melanin-containing peripheral polygonal cells and for synaptophysin in the small neuroblast-like cells [Figures and ].

The first chest x-ray revealed ground-glass opacity At this stage, the diagnosis is made solely on the basis of clinical signs and was subjected to treatment with chloroquine and Oseltamivir.
Blood test results were normal regarding both inflammation and respiratory parameters. Qualitative IgG/IgM was negative for both antibodies at the end of the symptoms. The patient was isolated at home and three weeks later the SARS-CoV-2 PCR assay was negative.
Approximately 93 days after her initial symptoms, she presented new clinical symptoms with dry cough, fever, shortness of breath, weakness, excessive sweating, hypotension, and acute depression. Resting heart rate (75/min) and oxygen saturation (less than 85%) and other symptoms led to hospitalization. During the hospitalization, blood test results showed leukocytosis 13000 with lymphopenia, increased D-dimer (240 ng/ml), and ferritin (267 mg/ml).

CR_ENG_203,English,"The second case of intranasal, cutaneous blastomycosis occurred in a 49-year-old female, also from Southern West Virginia. The patient first presented with symptoms of wheezing and cough, which she attributed to a progressive course of the “flu.” She had a medical history of diabetes and had been compliant with medication. She was previously a smoker and denied any recent travel. She stated that these pulmonary symptoms would occur “off and on” over the course of three months. She then discovered ulcerating lesions on the proximal knuckle of her right index finger (Figure ) and on her abdomen. Soon after, lesions appeared on her left intranasal passageway and middle of the upper lip (Figure ). Her primary care physician treated her for squamous cell carcinoma. She presented to the hospital after the condition had not improved. Her chest x-ray exhibited pulmonary masses. Further bronchoscopy exhibited several nodules on the lungs bilaterally. She underwent a biopsy, which was conclusive for blastomycosis, and debridement with itraconazole treatment was started for six to 12 months. At her four-month follow-up visit, the patient’s cutaneous and pulmonary manifestations had resolved. Unfortunately, her post-treatment pictures are not available.","

CR_ENG_206,English,"A 64-year-old woman with a history of Crohn’s disease (CD) was referred to Siriraj Hospital located in Bangkok, Thailand in June 2017 due to worsening of abdominal pain and watery diarrhea for 2 weeks. She was diagnosed with CD in 2010 after she presented with abdominal pain and palpable mass at the right lower quadrant (RLQ) of her abdomen. She was treated successfully with prednisolone 40 mg/day, azathioprine 50 mg/day, and mesalazine 2400 mg/day. Her disease was then controlled with prednisolone 5 mg/day and the same dose of azathioprine and mesalazine. One year after her CD diagnosis, she developed severe abdominal pain and diarrhea. A colonoscopy was performed, which showed inflamed mucosa and a clean-based ulcer at the cecum. Biopsy revealed an intracytoplasmic inclusion body, which is consistent with cytomegalovirus (CMV) colitis. Her symptoms gradually subsided after 3 weeks treatment of intravenous ganciclovir 5 mg/kg twice daily. Two years after her CD diagnosis, she began experiencing recurrent abdominal pain. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) and colonoscopic findings revealed a large polypoid mass at the ascending colon with partial colonic obstruction that was suspected to be caused by active CD. She was managed conservatively and was discharged home with prednisolone 30 mg/day, azathioprine 150 mg/day, and mesalazine 2400 mg/day after making substantial improvement. Even though she remained stable for about 4 years after her most recent discharge, she still required prednisolone 5 mg/day, azathioprine 150 mg/day, and mesalazine 2400 mg/day to control her disease activity. Her last colonoscopy with biopsy, which was performed 6 months earlier to monitor her disease activity, revealed a shallow 1 cm2 ulcer that was covered with white exudate at the cecum, and multiple polypoid masses at the ileocecal (IC) valve. The histopathologic findings revealed a chronic ulcer with marked active inflammation, a hyperplastic polyp with chronic ileitis, and no viral inclusion, dysplasia, or malignancy. Eight weeks ago, she started complaining of intermittent cramping at the RLQ of her abdomen. The dose of azathioprine was increased to 175 mg/day for presumed exacerbation of CD; however, her pain worsened, and she eventually developed a low-grade fever and watery diarrhea for 2 weeks before admission. She denied having any pulmonary symptoms. On examination, her body temperature was 38.6 °C and she had abdominal tenderness and a palpable mass at the RLQ of her abdomen. All other examination findings were unremarkable.
Laboratory investigations revealed a white blood cell (WBC) count of 2010 cells/mm3 with 90.5% neutrophils and 8.5% lymphocytes, and a hemoglobin level of 8.2 g/dl. Chest X-ray showed an oval-shaped cavitary lesion at the right lower lung (Fig. a). A CT scan of the chest revealed a large cavitary lesion (5.4 × 3.2 cm) with irregular wall thickening at the right lower lobe, and an adjacent focal centrilobular nodule with tree-in-bud pattern. A CT scan of the abdomen revealed chronic wall thickening at the cecum, IC valve, and terminal ilium, with submucosal edema and pericolic fat stranding. The patient underwent colonoscopy and biopsy, and a polypoid mass was observed at the IC valve with multiple clean-based ulcers at the cecum (Fig. a). Since the initial diagnosis was active CD, the tissue was sent only for histopathology. No fresh tissue was submitted for fungal culture. Pathologic examination of the tissue biopsy revealed active ileitis and colitis with multiple round shape organisms. The capsules of the observed organisms could be visualized by hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), Grocott-Gomori’s methenamine silver (GMS) staining, and mucicarmine stain, which is compatible with Cryptococcus spp. (Fig. ). Even though serum cryptococcal antigen was positive with a titer of 1:128, blood, bone marrow, and cerebrospinal fluid cultures for fungus were all negative.
The final diagnosis was disseminated cryptococcosis due to gastrointestinal and presumed pulmonary involvement. Initial induction therapy with amphotericin B deoxycholate (AmBD) 0.7 mg/kg per day was given for 6 weeks, followed by consolidation therapy with fluconazole 800 mg/day for 8 weeks. After consolidation, maintenance treatment with fluconazole 200 mg/day was prescribed for up to 1 year. After diagnosis of disseminated cryptococcosis, the immunosuppressive agents were adjusted as follow: discontinued azathioprine, decreased the dose of prednisolone to 15 mg/day, and maintained mesalazine at 2400 mg/day. Her clinical status was gradually improved, and the colonoscopy that was performed at 10 weeks after the start of treatment showing marked improvement in the polypoid mass-like lesion at the cecum (Fig. b). Even though the diagnosis of pulmonary cryptococcosis was not confirmed by pathology or microbiology, her chest X-ray the 3-month follow-up showed marked improvement (Fig. b).","

CR_ENG_208,English,"A 70-year-old male was diagnosed with Merkel Cell carcinoma of the right thigh (). The patient underwent surgical resection with close (<1 mm) surgical margins in 2012. Surgical pathology showed the tumor to be CD56, synaptophysin, and pancytokeratin positive by immunohistochemistry, with involvement of a single right inguinal lymph node. Due to close surgical margins and inguinal nodal involvement, the patient received adjuvant intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) to the right thigh and right pelvic and inguinal nodal region to a dose of 50 Gy delivered in 25 fractions (), as well as consolidative carboplatin and etoposide post-operatively. The patient then developed a radiation in-field recurrence involving the right external iliac and inguinal nodal region in 2015. Salvage right pelvic nodal dissection was performed where 15 nodes were removed with four harboring metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma.
Shortly after locoregional recurrence in the right pelvic nodal region, the patient developed metastatic disease involving bilateral pelvic nodes and the retroperitoneum on PET-scan (). Biopsy of the SUV-avid retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy confirmed metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. The patient was treated initially with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide and due to progressive disease was transitioned to single-agent pembrolizumab (200 mg IV every 3 weeks). After 5 months of therapy (7 cycles of pembrolizumab) the patient had a complete metabolic response with only sub-centimeter lymph nodes visible on CT. After 10 months of pembrolizumab (15 cycles), the patient had an isolated left inguinal and external iliac nodal progression (). For this reason, the patient was treated to the involved left inguinal and left external iliac nodes with IMRT to a dose of 45 Gy delivered in 25 fractions with concurrent pembrolizumab (), without any acute radiation side effects. Thereafter, the patient had complete imaging response of the left pelvic nodes as well as all other sites of metastatic disease outside of the radiation field at 3 months post-radiation by PET-response criteria in solid tumors (PERCIST) criteria (). At the present time (20 months post-radiation), the patient has received 39 cycles of pembrolizumab without evidence of cancer on serial imaging with mild rash as the only immune-related side effect.","

CR_ENG_209,English,"A 50 -year old woman, previously submitted to surgical aortic valve replacement in 2003 for aortic valve stenosis was admitted to a cardiac surgery unit for replacement of dysfunctioning mechanical valve prosthesis. Echocardiographic evaluation documented a prosthetic dysfunction with the evidence of an increased peak gradient up to 105 mmHg and a prosthetic valve area by 0.58 cm2 in a normal left ventricular function. Prosthetic valve replacement was then performed in August 2010. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was instituted between right atrium and ascending aorta and a moderate hypothermia was reached. Myocardial protection was achieved by retrograde injection of blood cardioplegia through coronary sinus as induction; it was completed by antegrade injection directly in both coronary ostia. After ascending aorta had been transversely opened, prosthetic dysfunction was evident as one of the hemidisks appeared to be locked by pannus ingrowth and fresh pivotal thrombi. No perivalvular leaks were described. The prosthesis was then removed; both coronary ostia were described quite close to the aortic annulus. Bovine pericardium bioprosthesis (Edwards Magna Ease 21 mm) was then implanted in supraannular position. Aortotomy was sutured using Teflon felt strips as reinforcement due to an extremely thin aortic wall and patient was uneventfully weaned from CPB. During skin suture patient experienced sudden severe hypotension; an ECG demonstrated signs of transmural myocardial ischemia. CPB was promptly reinstituted. Severe dilatation and hypokinesia of right ventricle and severe hypokinesia of interventricular septum were registered. Intraortic ballon pumping (IABP) was inserted through a femoral artery and a saphenous vein graft to right coronary artery (RCA) immediately added on a beating heart in the hypothesis of RCA ostial obstruction. At the end of the operation cardiopulmonary support by means of Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenator (ECMO) through femoro-femoral access was initiated and IABP removed. Patient was then transferred to Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for postoperative course. Graft verification was not performed, either intraoperatively and postoperatively. Two days after, following progressive decrease of ECMO support along with a satisfying hemodinamical recovery, she was transferred to the operating theatre to remove mechanical assistance. One hour after the new admission to the ICU, cardiac arrest occurred pushing surgical team to reposition an emergent ECMO at the ICU bed. The day after patient was transferred again to the theatre to remove thrombi from left atrium evident at ecographic inspection. At that moment cardiac activity was silent in a very compromised systemic condition. Two days after the new admission to the ICU under a new femoro-femoral support she was declared dead.
A complete post mortem examination was performed. Cerebral and pulmonary edema was detected. Cardiac size was mildly increased (11.5 × 10 × 7.7 cm), with conical shape; heart weight was increased (547g). At the inspection, a horizontal aortotomy was evident with prosthetic valve in situ after aorta was opened. Meticulous attention was devoted to observe the coronary ostia: the right one was not found at the inspection of inner surface of sinus of Valsalva. Using a metal probe inserted into right coronary artery distally cut, the entrapment of the ostium in a stitch at the level of prosthetic annulus became evident. Left coronary ostium was identified behind one of the bioprosthesis post that was responsible of its complete obstruction (Figure ). Coronary vessels were fully patent during their course. Equally patent appeared to be saphenous graft to RCA. The inspection of both ventricles showed many foci of pale myocardium diffused to either free wall and interventricular septum.
Histological investigations showed haemostasis of all organs and mild cerebral and pulmonary edema. Specimens taken from the heart showed diffuse stretching of the myocardium with elongation of the sarcomeres and nuclei. Polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration was well evident at the periphery of the necrosis zones (Figure ). Numerous foci of hypercontracted myocardial cells with markedly short sarcomeres and anomalous, extreme thickening of Z lines and rexis of the myofibrillar apparatus into cross-fibre, anomalous and irregular, up to a total granular disruption were also observed. Myocells pathological aspects were also studied on confocal laser scanning microscope: stretching of the myocardium in flaccid paralysis, resulting in a very early elongation of sarcomeres and nuclei; polymorphonuclear leucocyte infiltration was well evident.
Extramural coronary arteries showed nodular hyperplasia of smooth muscle cells and elastic tissue with fibrous replacement. Proteoglycan accumulation in the deep intima between tunica media and the fibrous cap was observed too. No critical stenosis was evident.
Final diagnosis of extensive myocardial infarction due to the intraoperative occlusion of both coronary ostia by bioprosthesis malpositioning was established as the cause of death.","

8. **Final Diagnosis:**"
CR_ENG_210,English,"A 52-year-old female, complaining from arterial hypertension, was diagnosed with a right-sided neck mass. After a year, an excisional biopsy was performed and, a year later, several complications appeared: a deviation of the right side of the tongue, hoarseness, troublesome swallowing, and right papilla atrophy. A year after the appearance of these complications, the patient was hospitalized for surgery. It was then when the presence of a VPGL on the right side of the neck, in the area of the carotid artery bifurcation, was determined by color duplex scanning. It was also found that regional lymph nodes were increased in size. A right-sided hypervascularized VPGL, 72 × 27 × 27 mm in size, spreading from the jugular hole to the carotid bifurcation, involving both the carotid artery and the hyoid nerve, was revealed by CT scans with 3D reconstruction, confirming the diagnosis. An ultrasound study of internal organs showed a moderately pronounced bilateral nephropathy and diffuse changes in pancreatic tissue. At surgery, it was found that the tumor originated from the vagus nerve and reached the base of the skull involving the hyoid nerve. The tumor was removed along with resection of both the vagus and hyoid nerves, the outer carotid artery, and regional lymph nodes. Histological examination revealed a typical organoid paraganglioma of alveolar and trabecular structure without regional lymph node metastasis. The patient was extubated in the operating room; however, the early postoperative period was complicated by cardiopulmonary failure, followed by aspiration pneumonia. The patient died 9 days after surgery.
For this patient, we performed whole-exome sequencing of two tumor samples from different FFPE blocks to validate sequencing data. Results obtained from both samples were in concordance with each other (Additional file ). We detected a likely pathogenic missense variant in the SDHB gene, NM_003000: c.A307G, p.M103V (chr1: 17355211, rs140178341). This variant is described in the ClinVar database as a variant with uncertain clinical significance. Its presence was previously detected for Cowden syndrome 2 (a hereditary cancer-predisposing syndrome), gastrointestinal stromal tumor, PGLs/PCCs, and PGL 4 syndrome, during clinical testing. Additionally, two novel frameshift mutations were found in SDHB, NM_003000: c.308_309insTAAG, p.M103fs (chr1: 17355209) and NM_003000: c.304_305insATGAT, p.A102fs (chr1: 17355213). A likely pathogenic missense variant was also observed in ARNT, NM_001197325: c.C1834T, p.R612C (chr1: 150788806, rs778430234); a variant that had not been previously reported, neither in the ClinVar nor in the COSMIC databases. However, likely pathogenic variants in the ARNT gene were earlier determined in CPGLs [].
According to several prediction algorithms, likely pathogenic variants as well as frameshift and stop-gain mutations were also identified in other genes (Additional file ). One of these distinctive genes is a novel likely pathogenic variant for RXFP1, NM_021634: c.G172A, p.D58N (chr4: 159493972). This gene encodes for the relaxin family peptide receptor 1, a protein related to RLN2/RXFP1 signaling that has been shown to mediate tumor cell motility and invasion in breast, thyroid, prostate, and endometrial cancers [–]. The induction of the CTRP8-RXFP1 ligand-receptor system increases the migration of glioblastoma cells []. Moreover, RXFP1 participates in cancer chemoresistance [].
A likely pathogenic variant NM_024776: c.C2908T, p.R970C (crh15: 77471361, rs117879553) in the PEAK1 gene was also revealed in this patient’s VPGL. The variant had not been described in the ClinVar or COSMIC databases. However, numerous studies have reported the involvement of PEAK1 in tumorigenesis [–].
The SLIT2 gene encodes for the slit homolog 2 protein, a ligand of the ROBO immunoglobulin receptor family. The SLIT/ROBO pathway plays an important role in axon guidance and neuronal precursor cell migration as well as in the regulation of angiogenesis []. We determined a likely pathogenic variant NM_004787: c.A934G, p.I312V (chr4: 20512137, rs139850475) for this gene. According to data from the literature, the SLIT/ROBO pathway has a dual effect in tumor growth and progression. On the one hand, SLIT/ROBO promotes tumor cell proliferation and migration []. On the other hand, it has been reported that SLIT2 is frequently inactivated in gliomas by hypermethylation at the CpG island within its promoter region and can act as a tumor suppressor gene [].
A likely pathogenic variant was also found in the AMPH gene, NM_001635: c.A2024G, p.Q675R (chr7: 38424483, rs147019216T). AMPH encodes for amphiphysin 1, localized in nerve terminals of mature neurons and participates in clathrin-mediated endocytosis [, ]. Noteworthy, the expression of amphiphysin 1 was detected in patients with stiff-person syndrome associated with breast and lung cancer, and melanoma []. Additionally, AMPH knockdown reduces apoptosis and promotes cell cycle progression and migration of breast cancer cells [].
In the HAPLN3 gene, we also identified a likely pathogenic variant, NM_178232: c.G316A, p.G106R (chr15: 89424765, rs140982817), described in the COSMIC database as associated with lung and caecum cancer (COSM1375297).","

CR_ENG_211,English,"A 67-year-old man presented with a history of change of bowel habits, blood in stool, and weight loss. His past medical history included only tobacco and alcohol use. According to his family history, two of his first-degree relatives had developed colonic cancer. A colonoscopy revealed the presence of a 4 cm mass approximately 10 cm from the anal verge and was confirmed to be a well-differentiated colon adenocarcinoma at a biopsy. Laboratory tests showed elevated serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) (8,07 ng/ml), elevated serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) (17,87 ng/ml), and elevated α-FP (17,9 ng/ml). The patient was seronegative for HBsAg and anti-HCV (IgM and IgG). His liver function tests were within normal limits. The abdominal MRI showed the presence of an 11 × 10, 5 × 10, 5 cm mass in the right hepatic lobe, with radiologic features consistent with a primary liver lesion (Figures and ). The CT-guided liver biopsy revealed a well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Additionally, because of the elevated PSA values, a prostate biopsy was performed. Seven core biopsies were taken from the left prostatic lobe and eight from the right lobe, and all of them were positive for prostatic adenocarcinoma (Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7/10).
Given the patient's good performance status, surgical resection for the hepatocellular carcinoma was considered. However, because of the small liver remnant, it was decided to first perform transarterial chemoembolization, to partially control the hepatocellular carcinoma (). Two weeks later, the rectal carcinoma was treated by low anterior resection (). After six weeks, right portal vein embolization was performed to allow for hypertrophy of the liver remnant (). Finally, one month later, the hepatocellular carcinoma was treated by right hepatectomy (Figures and ). Active surveillance was adopted for the prostate cancer.
Histopathological evaluation of the rectal specimen showed a moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma Stage IIA (T3N0M0) and a well-differentiated hepatocellular adenocarcinoma Stage IIIA (T3N0M0). Recovery was uneventful, and the patient remained disease-free up until the 2-year follow-up when he died of acute myocardial infarction.","

CR_ENG_213,English,"In January 2013 a 44 year old white female presented to our institution with malaise, exertional breathlessness, night sweats and a headache. She had received a pre-emptive deceased donor kidney transplant 5 years earlier. The kidney characteristics were donation after circulatory death [DCD], human leucocyte antigen (HLA) mismatch A1:B1:DR1, cytomegalovirus (CMV) serology of both donor and recipient were negative but Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) serology of the donor was positive whereas the recipient was negative. The aetiology of end stage renal disease was likely congenital, initial presentation was with advanced chronic kidney disease and a single functioning kidney. The only baseline comorbidity was congenital nystagmus. Primary graft function was excellent and stabilised with serum creatinine 90 μmol/L [1.0 mg/dL] and eGFR 60 ml/min/1.73 m2. Induction immunosuppression was with basiliximab and maintenance was tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil and prednisolone, as per local protocols. She had been treated with valganciclovir for CMV viraemia at 3 months and mycophenolate was electively withdrawn in line with institutional protocol after 7 months. The patient continued on dual immunosuppressive therapy thereafter and there were no episodes of acute rejection. Otherwise she had an uneventful first 5 years except for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 1 and acne rosacea.
On examination she was pale, jaundiced and tachycardic, with dark urine. There was no lymphadenopathy. All investigations are shown in Additional file : Table S1. They demonstrated a severe anaemia (haemoglobin 57 g/L) with parameters consistent with haemolysis. DAT was positive confirming a warm agglutinin AIHA. She required blood transfusion support and was initially treated with high dose prednisolone (1 mg/kg) with little effect. A 5 day course of intravenous immunoglobulin (0.4 g/kg/day) was started on day 9. At this point a high serum titre of EBV (538355 copies/ml) was detected with serology suggesting this was reactivation from previous exposure to donor virus and not a primary infection (see Additional file : Table S1). She went on to have a total body CT scan which detected no abnormal lymphadenopathy and a bone marrow aspirate and trephine was consistent with haemolysis and no evidence of a lymphoproliferative disorder. Tacrolimus was converted to sirolimus on day 28. After an initial fall in serum EBV load there was a deterioration in clinical state with increasing transfusion requirements followed by an increase in EBV load. The patient was given rituximab 375 mg/m2 on day 30, followed by a further three weekly doses. At the beginning of the treatment course she had received 16 units of blood and the EBV viral load was 268649 copies/ml. After the fourth dose of rituximab there was a significant decline in transfusion requirement and the EBV viral load had fallen to undetectable levels. Seven transfusions were required during the rituximab course and three following the course. Her serial haemoglobin, LDH, EBV viral load, rituximab doses and transfusions are shown in Fig. . She had achieved complete remission 2 weeks after starting the rituximab. There was no deleterious effect on graft function and no adverse drug events were noted. In total she required 26 units of blood with significant iron overload, the serum ferritin rose to 2850 μg/L which had fallen to 950 μg/L 12 months after remission. Despite the acute illness graft function was unchanged and she remains well on prednisolone and sirolimus immunosuppression with no recurrence of EBV viraemia or anaemia.","

CR_ENG_214,English,"A 60-year-old man presented with rapidly progressing left facial palsy and severe retro-auricular pain. He had not experienced vestibular symptoms; however, the patient reported hearing loss and tinnitus on the left ear. Before coming to our center, he had consulted a private ENT (Ear-Nose-Throat) clinic. Despite the unusually severe pain, an initial diagnosis of symptoms was Ramsay-Hunt syndrome, and oral steroid therapy was initiated. He had also undergone left-sided nephrectomy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) 2 years earlier, and metastasis to a hilar lymph node had been detected 1 year postoperatively. No local recurrence had been observed, and molecular targeted therapy (sunitinib) had been performed for the RCC metastasis at the first consultation in our center. Past otologic history included left-sided middle ear surgery for cholesteatoma more than 30 years earlier, which had presented as the ipsilateral conductive hearing loss on pure tone audiogram and awareness of discontinuous otorrhea. Ear endoscopy revealed a reddened region around the posterior-superior ear canal (Fig. ), but no mucosal otorrhea or perforation of the tympanic membrane or posterior canal wall was observed. High-resolution CT revealed an intratympanic and mastoid mass involving the facial nerve in the mastoid and tympanic segments (Fig. ). Due to the postoperative state, distinguishing whether the pathology represented recurrent cholesteatoma, viral infection, or tumor invasion was difficult. Otalgia was not able to be controlled using oral analgesics, so exploratory tympanotomy and mastoidectomy were planned for biopsy at the perifacial nerve on the day following the first visit, to avoid any delays in diagnosis of a potentially malignant tumor. The patient and his family consented to biopsy of the facial nerve envelope. No cholesteatoma was detected on biopsy, and granulomatous tissue was seen to be filling the tympanic and mastoid cavities. Beneath the granulomatous tissue, a white mass was observed involving the facial nerve. A biopsy specimen was obtained from around the mastoid segment of the facial nerve, and histologic appearance of the specimen demonstrated patterns of clear cell type-RCC compatible with metastasis of the original tumor (Fig. ). Otalgia and retro-auricular pain were relieved for a few days after surgery, but severe pain recurred, and postoperative MRI showed a mass occupying the sigmoid sinus, indicating hematogenous metastasis (Fig. ). Consultation with experts in urology led to palliative care.","

CR_ENG_217,English,"A 66-year-old Japanese woman was hospitalized due to heart failure. She presented with palpitations, shortness of breath, decreased urine output, leg edema, and orthopnea. She had been diagnosed with dilatation of the pulmonary artery (PA) during childhood, but the details were unknown. She had been hospitalized due to heart failure at age 50 years, but details of that hospitalization were unknown. Since then, she has been evaluated on an outpatient basis.
Blood pressure was 106/62 mm Hg and heart rate was 92 beats per minute. A grade 3/6, medium-pitch, systolic murmur at 3 left sternal border and grade 3/6, medium-pitch, diastolic murmur at 2 left sternal border were heard on chest auscultation. Peripheral oxygen saturation using pulse oximetry in room air was 89%.
Electrocardiography showed atrial fibrillation and complete right bundle branch block. Echocardiography showed an enlarged right ventricle, marked dilatation of the PA, moderate pulmonary regurgitation, and severe mitral regurgitation (deterioration from mild regurgitation). Left ventricular function was mildly depressed. In addition, the patient was diagnosed with hyperthyroidism. Computed tomography showed dilatation of the main PA, right PA, and left PA (, A and B).
Cardiac catheterization showed normal PA pressure and absence of intracardiac shunting. PA systolic pressure was 22 mm Hg, PA diastolic pressure was 3 mm Hg, and mean PA pressure was 14 mm Hg. Angiocardiography confirmed the echocardiographic findings of PA dilatation, pulmonary regurgitation, and severe mitral regurgitation. The patient was therefore scheduled to undergo mitral valve replacement and reduction of the diameter of the PA.
Surgery was performed when she was aged 66 years. Intraoperatively, dilatations of the right ventricle and pulmonary trunk were noted. First, mitral valve replacement was performed using a mechanical 25-mm valve (Carbomedics, Inc, Austin, Tex). Evaluation of the mitral valve revealed no chordal rupture or elongation, and thus no prolapse. The mitral valve leaflets were degenerated and the left ventricle was dilated. Tethering was believed to be the cause of mitral regurgitation. Next, the main PA was transected along its entire circumference. Examination of the PV revealed a normal right-facing leaflet, normal left lateral-facing leaflet, and absence of the posterior nonfacing leaflet (, A, and ). No endocarditis was evident. The PV annulus measured approximately 21 mm in diameter. Confirming isolated absence of the posterior leaflet, a trapezoid-shaped cut bovine pericardial graft was sutured to the annulus of the posterior nonfacing cusp, to create a new valve leaflet, with adequate redundancy and reservoir during diastole (, B, and ). Trapezoid-shaped cuts were made on the anterior walls of the right, left, and main PAs, then sutured to reduce the diameter of the PA. Intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography performed after the repair revealed good coaptation of the PV leaflets and trivial regurgitation.
Echocardiographic evaluation 1 week postoperatively indicated no pericardial effusion, normal functioning of the mechanical mitral valve, no pulmonary stenosis, and mild pulmonary regurgitation. The diameter of the main PA was 35 mm. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography performed 1 week postoperatively indicated a reduction in diameter of the main PA to 52 mm, from the preoperative value of 66 mm (, A and B). Reduction of left atrial volume was also noted. Repeat echocardiography 1 year later showed a dilated right ventricle with slightly depressed systolic function and dilatation of the pulmonary trunk. The PV leaflets showed good mobility. No pulmonary stenosis was evident and only mild pulmonary insufficiency was present. The mechanical mitral valve was functioning well and the patient remained clinically asymptomatic.

CR_ENG_220,English,"A 66-year-old male with New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage IV heart failure, severe aortic stenosis, severe aortic insufficiency and porcelain aorta underwent implantation of a HeartMate II LVAD as destination therapy by the Cardiac Transplant and Mechanical Heart Service at our institution on October 26, 2013. Nine months later, routine laboratory follow up done July 20, 2014 revealed an elevated total bilirubin of 6.3 (0.2–1.1 mg/dL). Abdominal ultrasound showed cholelithiasis and intra- and extra-hepatic biliary ductal dilation. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) was not able to delineate the distal common bile duct or pancreas head area due to LVAD artifact (Figs. a and b). At this point, the patient's anticoagulation was reversed and the patient underwent endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP). Fluoroscopy for the ERCP was limited by the LVAD, however, a tight distal common bile duct stricture of about 2 cm in length was noted (Fig. ). ERCP was followed immediately by endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) that showed a 2.8 cm pancreatic head mass (Fig. ). On EUS, the mass was not abutting the portal vein, superior mesenteric vein, superior mesenteric artery or celiac artery. Also, there was no significant lymphadenopathy per EUS. Fine needle aspiration of the pancreatic head mass was consistent with adenocarcinoma. Rest of the work-up included a chest-CT which was negative for metastatic disease, CA19-9 was 27 (0–37 U/mL). The case was discussed at our multidisciplinary liver and pancreas tumor board and after several care conferences with the family and involved providers, the decision was made to proceed with a pancreaticoduodenectomy on August 14, 2014.
Initial diagnostic laparoscopy was negative for metastatic disease, and confirmed expected adhesions to the LVAD Gortex pouch that is fashioned from the diaphragm (Fig. ). After confirming the absence of metastatic disease, we then proceeded with a standard pancreaticoduodenectomy. We also had to do a small segment side bite resection of the portal vein with primary repair due to suspected involvement. He tolerated the procedure well and without any blood transfusions, estimated blood loss was 200 mL. He was extubated at the end of the case and was transferred to the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit for further care. A drain left around the hepatico and pancreatico jejunal anastomosis was removed on post-operative Day #3 after checking the amylase level per our institutional protocol. By post-operative Day #8 he was tolerating a regular soft diet and having regular bowel function. He did not have any infectious or bleeding complications post-operatively. He stayed in the hospital until post-operative Day #17 mainly for close management of his overall fluid status and optimizing anticoagulation per the Mechanical Heart team. His final pathology showed a 3.0 cm, well differentiated tumor, without lympho-vascular invasion, with peri-neural invasion, with three lymph nodes positive by direct extension out of 17 total, surgical margins clear of cancer, Stage IIB, T3N1M0.
Approximately 6 weeks after surgery, he was started on adjuvant chemotherapy with single agent Gemcitabine. He completed total of 6 months of Gemcitabine without major side effects.
At the time this report was drafted, the patient was 30 months out from surgery with no evidence of recurrent disease.","

CR_ENG_221,English,"A 22 year old, previously healthy Sri Lankan female presented to the government hospital of Udupila, Sri Lanka, in September 2016, around 10.00 a.m., 1 h after self-ingestion of 28 tablets of FDC-IR which contained 4.2 g of standard INH and 7.2 g of rifampicin which was prescribed for her uncle, in an attempt of deliberate self-harm after a domestic dispute. The family had attempted induced emesis with water and coconut milk at home unsuccessfully.
On admission the patient had dizziness, nausea and vomiting. While being seeing in the medical ward at 10.30 a.m., she developed generalized tonic–clonic seizure which lasted about 3 min and associated with loss of consciousness. She was given IV diazepam 5 mg immediately. However gastric lavage and activated charcoal were not given due to reduced level of consciousness which was attributed to post ictal drowsiness. She was transferred to the national hospital of Sri Lanka immediately for further care.
She arrived to the national hospital around 12.30 p.m. (in 3.5 h of poisoning), with persistent vomiting, dizziness and headache. On examination, she was drowsy, but oriented and rational. No evidence of asterixis or coagulopathy. Orange–red discoloration of the face, hands and feet was noted even with the dark skin complexion. She also had orange–red colour urine (Fig. ) and vomitus. Her pulse rate was 104 beats/min, regular and blood pressure 130/80 mmHg. The respiratory rate was 20 breaths/min, pulse oximetry of 98% on room air and auscultation of lungs normal. Abdomen and nervous system examination was unremarkable.
The arterial blood gas analysis was as follows; pH 7.36, HCO3-20 mmol/L, PCO2 24 mmHg, pO2 135 mmHg, Base excess-5, lactate level 2.3 and O2 saturation 100%. Considering the clinical presentation with neurological toxicity and the large amount of Isoniazid dose ingested, administration of antidote was decided. Since IV pyridoxine was not available at the hospital, crushed oral tablets of pyridoxine 4.2 g (equal to INAH dose ingested) administered immediately via a nasogastric tube and there were no recurrent seizures subsequently requiring repeated administration of pyridoxine. Simultaneously forced diuresis was commenced using IV 0.9% saline in order to enhance excretion of toxic metabolites via kidneys.
Her initial lab investigations revealed, white blood cell count of 14,870 (neutrophil 12,870); haemoglobin 12.3 g/dL; platelets 241,000; serum creatinine 58 µmol/L (normal 60–120 µmol/L); serum sodium 138 mmol/L (normal 135–148 mmol/L); potassium 3.9 mmol/L (3.5–5.1 mmol/L); aspartate transaminase (AST) 39 U/L (normal <5 U/L); alanine transaminase (ALT) 21 U/L (normal <35 U/L), total bilirubin 63 µmol/L (normal 5–21 µmol/L); prothrombin time (PT) 13.1 s; international normalizing ratio (INR) 1.03 and electrocardiogram was normal. Her liver functions started to deteriorate from Day 2 with persistent anorexia and vomiting and gradually started to improve by Day 7 of admission. Highest values of liver functions reported were, AST 161 U/L; ALT 215 U/L; PT 18.5 s; INR 1.42. Mild metabolic acidosis present on admission was completely corrected by Day 2. She was provided with supportive care for acute liver injury and she made complete recovery upon discharge on Day 10 of the hospital admission. Her liver functions found to be normal 1 week after the discharge.","

CR_ENG_223,English,"A 38-year-old woman with a medical story of head induced vertigo for less than two weeks was admitted to the outpatient clinic. She had no evident associated problem and could be defined as an “idiopathic” case. A verbal consent and a signed informed consent were obtained from the patient. The procedures were in accordance with the ethical standards of the Declaration of Helsinki and of the institutional review board. Diagnosis of PC-BPPV was based on medical history and the presence of upbeating rotational nystagmus during head-hanging maneuver when the affected ear is down. However, there was no nystagmus on the right side. But, on the left side, counterclockwise, rotational, torsional, and upbeating nystagmus was seen initially which was later followed by clockwise rotational nystagmus while keeping the head at the hanging position which confirmed a left-sided PC-BPPV. The patient was also subjected to head-roll and straight head-hanging maneuvers which were not remarkable. Inversion of the nystagmus was documented when the patient got back to sitting position. Videonystagmography (Micromed, Inc., USA) recording confirmed a new variant of PC-BPPV (video-link) (see Supplementary Material available online at ). Latency was very brief (5 seconds). First phase of nystagmus appeared immediately after bringing the patient's head to head-hanging position and lasted 15 seconds followed by a “silent phase” for another 10 seconds as seen on video. Then, a second phase of nystagmus appeared lasting for 40 seconds. Whole event happened in 80 seconds. The intensity of the first-phase nystagmus was stronger than that of second phase. Maximal slow phase velocity was calculated as 6 and 3 degrees/sec for the first phase and second phase of nystagmus, respectively. However, the second-phase nystagmus lasted longer. The patient was completely cured after one single Epley maneuver for the left side. Schematic view of rotatory, torsional, and upbeating nystagmus (clockwise) during head-hanging position in patients with a common left-sided PC-BPPV is seen in .

CR_ENG_224,English,"A 22-year-old male patient reported to the prosthodontic department with a defective right hand finger which was amputated in an industrial accident 3 years back. Since surgical reconstruction was not possible, the site was covered with a skin flap at that time and the healing was uneventful []. As the patient was a dental assistant, his job mainly involved the use of the right hand, especially the index finger which was used for writing and handling dental materials and so wanted to rehabilitate the defect with a retentive prosthesis.
Physical examination of the hand showed that the patient's index finger was amputated at the level of the distal phalange, but the joint was preserved and functional.
Conventional acrylic resin finger prosthesis was fabricated for knowing the acceptance and adaptability level of the patient to an artificial prosthesis. The acceptance was satisfactory, but patient was disappointed with the poor retention of the same. Multiple treatment options were discussed with the patient and patient showed willingness toward the osseointegrated finger prosthesis fabrication.
A radiographic analysis of the residual finger was done, palmar, and lateral views were made to evaluate the skeleton's bone density and dimensions. Routine blood investigations were carried out. The case was discussed with relevant medical specialty surgeons and oral and maxillofacial surgeon.
Since the case was done for the first time by the surgeon and prosthodontist, a cadaver study was planned and carried out successfully.
An implant retained finger prosthesis was finalized and it was decided to be done using a two stage surgery technique which is considered as the standard protocol.[] An informed consent was obtained from the patient. Prophylactic antibiotics were prescribed.
The surgical procedures were performed in the dental implant operatory of the department, under strict asepsis.
Routine presurgical scrubbing was carried out and the area was isolated. Then, the Right index finger's digital nerve was anaesthetized with 2% lignocaine without epinephrine and hemostasis was obtained using a tourniquet at 250 mmHg. The right hand was kept on a flat platform. Skin incision was made at the implant site and a skin flap was elevated. The osteotomy was started with a 2 mm pilot drill, the position and the angulation of the osteotomy was guided by radiovisiography (RVG) []. The bone density was observed as Type IV according to Lekholm and Zarb classification.[] Sequential drilling was done to insert a 3.5 mm (diameter) × 11.5 mm (length) Adin Touareg dental implant (Afula, Israel). The osteotomy site was irrigated with copious amount of saline and betadine. The implant was manually inserted using a hand wrench with 30 N torque. A cover screw was placed and the flap was repositioned using nylon sutures []. RVG was taken from various angles to verify the position of the implant and a pressure dressing was given and was changed once in 3 days. The patient was also asked to care for the wound. The healing was uneventful and on the 10th day the sutures were removed. The superficial skin layer was found to be necrotized and the color of the skin had darkened, careful debridement was carried out and the issue was resolved.
At 5th month follow-up, the radiographs revealed a fine degree of osseous integration of the implant and the absence of infection and other complications.
A second stage surgery was planned after 5 months. The soft tissue covering the implant was measured and was found to be 5 mm, hence to obtain an ideal soft tissue cover the sub mucosal tissue was scooped out using a tissue curette. By reducing the distance between the implant platform and the prosthesis the leverage forces on the implant fixture can be reduced. The possibilities of secondary infections can also be controlled by limiting the excessive soft tissue thickness around the abutment.[] A healing collar (3 mm) was attached to the implant and sutures were given []. The patient was recalled for the impression procedures after 2 weeks. The healing collar was replaced with an open tray impression coping. The impression was made using polyether impression material (Impregum, 3M, St. Paul, USA) by using a custom impression tray which was earlier fabricated using a cylindrical measuring jar. A cast was obtained with type 4 die stone with a soft tissue simulator at the collar region.
The open tray transfer coping was modified to be used as a custom abutment. Self-cure clear acrylic was molded into a ribbed form along the sides of the coping converting it to a retentive abutment for the silicone prosthesis []. A full anatomy index finger was sculpted using modeling wax and a wax trial was carried out to ensure the angulations and appearance was life-like. The pattern was invested in a dental flask and kept in a dewaxing unit to eliminate the wax. The mold space was then filled with medical grade silicone with intrinsic stains (M72 Full Prosthetics Starter Kit, Technovent Ltd., South Wales, UK) to simulate the exact color of the patient's skin. The silicone was cured at room temperature according to the manufacturer's instructions. An acrylic nail was fabricated using self-cure acrylic resin, by incorporating intrinsic stains. The nail was attached to the prosthesis using adhesive primer (G611 Platinum Primer-Technovent Ltd, South Wales, UK). The finished and polished prosthesis was gently pushed over the ribbed area of the custom abutment and it exhibited good retentive ability. The insertion and removal of the prosthesis was easy and patient was satisfied with the function of the prosthesis. The patient could hold a pen and write immediately after insertion []. Instructions were given on the maintenance of the prosthesis as well as the peri implant area.
Patient was asked to wash the area with Luke warm water and clean the area with a soft dental brush. Since the prosthesis is subjected to wear and tear, it has to be reviewed regularly and if needed to be refabricated. The mold was retained in the dental flask for further remaking.
Patient reported for review after 1 month and the site was examined in detail, no postoperative infections were observed and the bone loss was within the acceptable limits. The patient was able to do his day today work and social activities with confidence.","

CR_ENG_226,English,"This 14-year-old female presented with chief concerns including severe dental crowding, increased overbite and overjet, and recessive chin. She and her parents were not interested in any surgical intervention for her recessive chin. Her medical history was not contributory, and her growth spurt was already passed as confirmed from her maturity indicator from CVM and physical/menstrual history. Her parents reported that she is a mouth breather and opens her mouth during sleep. Clinical records (A–E) and cephalometric analysis () revealed a convex profile with recessive chin.
The patient has a dolichofacial type with compensated Class II skeletal base relationship (ANB = 8.4°, SNB = 74.1°; FMA = 36.4°). Intraoral photos and digital models revealed a Class II division 2 malocclusion with increased overjet (5.5 mm) and impinging overbite (95%), as well as moderate upper and lower dental crowding (5 mm in each arch).
Treatment plan and progress: The patient and parents were made aware of the challenges of mouth breathing habit and its detrimental effects on treatment outcomes and stability. In addition, myofunctional therapy was proposed using a trainer for braces (T4B, Myobrace, Rancho Cucamonga, CA, USA) that was prescribed to be worn one hour during the day and night time with vertical-pull chin cup (Jaw Bra, Chanhassen, MN, USA). The treatment plan included sequential distalization of the upper posterior teeth utilizing light (3/16 3.5 ounce) Class II elastics for inter-maxillary anchorage and torqueing of upper incisors’ roots palatally. The vertical-pull chin cup together with occlusal coverage of the posterior teeth with the Invisalign aligners (working as posterior bite blocks) were intended to intrude posterior teeth. The first batch of aligners included 69 aligners; however, at stage 35 (F–H), the patient was supposed to have molars in an end-to-end relationship, but due to the patient’s non-compliance, a decision was made to rescan the patient’s teeth for additional aligners that revealed the Class I molars over correction (I–L). At that time, the patient was provided with VPro5 to use for 5 min per day to help with aligner seating if the patient experienced pain or if the aligners became ill-fitting due to long periods of time she was not wearing aligners during the day (12–16 h per day aligner wear per her report). The patient also could not use the Jaw Bra as prescribed, so the new additional aligners incorporated sequential posterior teeth intrusion to allow forward rotation of the mandible. In addition, the upper inter-premolars distances were expanded to correct the crossbite observed at stage 35 of the first batch of aligners (35/69). Lower incisor retroclination was prescribed using IPR of the lower incisors to help with minimizing anterior interference when the mandible was to be auto-rotated forward. When the patient used VPro5, she was able to change her aligners every 5–7 days considering her noncompliance with daily aligner wear (12–16 h of daily aligner wear).
When she used VPro5, her total treatment time was one year. Final records (M–Q) showed maintenance of her vertical dimension (no change of FMA ()), improved apical-base relationship (ANB = 6.7°), lower incisor retroclination (IMPA = 87.5°). Although her mandibular apical base was moved forward (SNB = 76.7°), this improvement was counteracted by the lower posterior teeth extrusion (Q) due to noncompliance with the Jaw Bra and existence of the mouth-breathing habit especially at night time. Overall superimposition shows the downward displacement of the mandible, which was due to extrusion of lower molars that could have been prevented by using the Jaw Bra.","

CR_ENG_227,English,"A 70-year-old male patient presented with painless, total gross hematuria. He had a history of urethral stricture due to a motor vehicle accident, and visual internal urethrotomy had been performed 9 years previously. He also had hypertension that was being treated medically. Abdominopelvic computed tomography (CT) showed an approximately 2.7-cm lobulated and contoured enhancing mass in the bladder dome within the diverticulum with no definite pelvic lymph node enlargement (). After transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, we performed a partial cystectomy at the bladder dome. Because the tumor was a small 2.7-cm mass, without pelvic lymph node enlargement, and limited to the bladder dome on CT, we performed partial cystectomy. The margins were negative in the frozen biopsy. Grossly, firm whitish gray masses were seen (). The pathology report was squamous cell carcinoma, infiltrating the serosa. Microscopically, the bladder tumor was composed of keratin-producing malignant cells ().
Three months postoperatively, frequency and nocturia occurred. Follow-up abdominopelvic CT showed a new approximately 4.7-cm×4.0-cm lobulate, heterogeneous mass in the dome of the bladder. CT also revealed another 2.9-cm×2.3-cm hypodense mass with peripheral rim enhancement in the right upper abdomen (). After we inserted a Foley catheter, bowel materials and feces were evacuated through the Foley catheter. Cystography showed that contrast media leaked to the ileum (). Abdominopelvic CT showed an enlarged mass at the dome of the bladder and noted communication with the sigmoid colon (). Ileostomy was done in the department of surgery. Eventually, bladder squamous cell carcinoma spread to multiple organs and the patient died of multiple organ failure 6 months later.","

CR_ENG_228,English,"The patient in this case study was a 70-year-old man (height 152 cm, weight 57 kg) with a history of hypertension who was receiving treatment from an ophthalmologist for pain in the right eye and blurred vision. He had been prescribed a course of loxoprofen sodium (60 mg), but the treatment was ineffective. He was referred to our hospital 5 days after symptom onset. In addition to the right eye pain and diplopia, findings during our initial examination included ipsilateral palpebral ptosis and oculomotor dysfunction, and oculomotor nerve paralysis was suspected. Simple cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed no intracranial space-occupying or periorbital lesions. The patient was prescribed tramadol hydrochloride (25 mg) for the eye pain, and the pain was relieved. However, the palpebral ptosis and diplopia persisted, and the patient was hospitalized for observation and treatment.
The findings at hospitalization are shown in Fig. . The patient showed limited lateral movement and elevation of the right eye in addition to palpebral ptosis but had no problems with visual acuity. Thus, he was diagnosed with incomplete oculomotor paralysis of the right eye. Cranial gadolinium-contrast MRI revealed slight expansion of the right cavernous sinus (relative to the contralateral site) but no clear signs of a tumor (Fig. ). We ruled out diabetes-induced painful ophthalmoplegia, sarcoidosis, and other inflammatory diseases, as well as cerebrovascular disease based on the patient’s symptoms, physical examination, and imaging results. Considering the above findings, we suspected THS accompanied by oculomotor paralysis.
Sixteen days after symptom onset, the patient started steroid pulse therapy; he was treated with intravenous methylprednisolone at 1000 mg/day for 3 days. The patient developed hiccups, which are an adverse drug reaction to methylprednisolone, but this symptom disappeared after treatment with metoclopramide and shakuyakukanzoto, a Chinese herbal medicine (). The following day, the pain in the right eye disappeared, and the palpebral ptosis showed some improvement; however, the oculomotor dysfunction and diplopia persisted. The patient was started on a course of oral prednisolone at 60 mg/day subsequent to the steroid pulse therapy.
The patient developed progressively aggravated delirium at 5 days after the initiation of steroid pulse therapy. He showed clouding of consciousness accompanied by speech disturbance, abnormal sleep cycle, and marked appetite loss. No abnormalities were revealed on a cranial computed tomography scan performed that day, and the delirium was considered an adverse reaction to methylprednisolone. Accordingly, the oral prednisolone treatment (60 mg/day) was temporarily suspended. The delirium resolved subsequent to this suspension of treatment. By the day after prednisolone was suspended, the patient’s level of consciousness had recovered to the pretreatment level.
Two days after resolution of the delirium, oral prednisolone treatment was resumed at 10 mg/day. The patient manifested no subsequent hiccups, delirium, or disturbance of consciousness. The pain in the right eye completely disappeared, and palpebral ptosis, impaired right-eye elevation, and diplopia resolved. The prednisolone treatment at 10 mg/day was continued, and the patient was discharged from the hospital. After discharge, the oral prednisolone dose was tapered and then stopped at 53 days after the start of therapy. The patient showed no relapse after prednisolone cessation, and his treatment was regarded as complete. Follow-up MRI was not carried out since the patient smoothly recovered from the illness.","

CR_ENG_231,English,"A 1-day-old full-term male newborn with birth body weight 2930 gm was diagnosed with a double-outlet right ventricle {S, D, D} with a subpulmonary ventricular septal defect (Taussig-Bing anomaly) and a right aortic arch associated with a right-sided PDA. He underwent palliative pulmonary artery banding through left minithoracotomy when he was 20 days old, but the PDA was not ligated at that time due to its right-sided position. The postoperative Doppler echocardiography showed peak velocity of the systolic jet across the main pulmonary artery band was 4.0 m/s, which indicated the estimated peak pressure gradient across the band was 64 mmHg. However, the heart failure in the newborn was still uncontrollable despite adequately performed and hemodynamically effective pulmonary artery banding. Thus, transcatheter occlusion of the PDA (Krichenko Type A1, 1.7 mm at its narrowest potion) (Fig. a) was performed via a retrograde route using a Gianturco coil (MWCE-38-6-4, Cook, Inc., Bloomington, IN) on the 25th day of life. Postimplantation aortography showed no residual shunting, but approximately half of the coil was extruded into the pulmonary artery with a resultant redundant and bulky appearance (Fig. b).
Unexpectedly, he developed gross hematuria 3 h later. The laboratory data 1 day after coil implantation revealed elevated serum total bilirubin (from 9.1 to 14.7 mg/dl; normal range 0.1–1.2 mg/dl), increased serum lactate dehydrogenase (1796 U/L; normal range 135–260 U/L), decreased hemoglobin (from 11.8 to 11.2 g/dl; normal range 9.6–12.8 g/dl) (Fig. ) and reduced serum haptoglobin (< 7.69 mg/dl; normal range 30–200 mg/dl). The postimplantation echocardiography showed no residual ductal shunting, but part of the coil was extruded into the bifurcation of the main pulmonary artery, in addition to the high-velocity mosaic pulmonary flow jet resulting from the previously performed pulmonary artery banding. It also showed the high-velocity pulmonary flow jet hit the extruded coil. (Fig. and Additional file : Video 1; Fig. and Additional file : Video 2). The postimplantation computed tomography angiography more clearly demonstrated that part of the coil was extruded into the junction of the main and right pulmonary arteries (Figs. , , ). We did not know the exact cause of the suspected hemolysis at this time. Over the following days, we were only able to correct his refractory anemia by repeated blood transfusion with packed RBCs and frequently monitor his hemoglobin, serum total bilirubin, and serum lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. ).
At day 24 postimplantation, reticulocytosis (reticulocyte count 5.4%; normal range 0.4–2.8%) was noted. A peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes and fragmented RBCs. Both direct and indirect Coombs tests were negative. Thus, intravascular nonimmune hemolysis was more definitively diagnosed. After review of a previous similar case report [] and the postimplantation images (Figs. , , , , and Additional file : Video 1; Additional file : Video 2), we speculated that a high-velocity pulmonary blood flow jet coming into contact with the extruded part of the coil led to RBC mechanical injury, thereby resulting in the hemolysis [, ]. The high-velocity pulmonary blood flow jet resulted from the previously performed pulmonary artery banding.
At that time, we decided to adopt expectant management in expectation of the endothelialization of the coil with a resultant reduction in the hemolysis []. Fortunately, the degree of hemolysis began decreasing gradually until spontaneous resolution 81 days postimplantation, as reflected in the gradual reduction in serum total bilirubin and lactate dehydrogenase and a reduced need for blood transfusion (total amount of transfused packed RBCs: 1127 ml/36 transfusions) (Fig. ). The patient then underwent Jatene procedure at 111 days of age (day 86 postimplantation). Unfortunately, he expired 9 h postoperatively due to low cardiac output syndrome after the extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support was removed.

CR_ENG_232,English,"A 46-year-old Japanese woman presented at the hospital with the chief complaints of gross hematuria and pain during urination. Cystoscopy revealed a large smooth-surfaced tumor in the urinary bladder, reaching from the posterior wall to the dome (fig. ). The patient underwent transurethral resection of the bladder tumor, and the histopathological diagnosis was undifferentiated carcinoma. The tumor expanded rapidly as the patient was examined in preparation for total cystectomy. Bilateral hydronephrosis manifested after approximately 1 month. Due to doubts regarding permeation of the digestive tract as shown by CT, the option of further surgery was abandoned and a nephrostomy was performed in conjunction with chemotherapy (cT4N0M0).
The patient then received 3 courses of MVAC over a 3-month period. The hydronephrosis disappeared after the first course, and the tumor shrank rapidly (fig. ). After completion of the third MVAC course, total cystectomy and ileal conduit surgery were performed. Interoperatively, no anomalies were found in the abdominal cavity, but the bladder was shown to be firmly accreted to the pelvic wall, which was separated incrementally. An isolated preparation revealed what was thought to be white necrotic tissue (pT1, pN0, ew0, ly0, v0, n0). After 7 years, the patient has still had no recurrences or metastases.","

CR_ENG_234,English,"A 64-year-old Hispanic woman with a past medical history of hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and transient ischemic attack presented with a chief complaint of chest pain. The pain was severe enough to wake her from sleep around 6.00 a.m. Pain was 8/10 and described as pressure and as if someone had punched her on left side of her chest with an associated tingling sensation in her left arm and fingers. She related her chest discomfort to the recent familial conflict. The pain did not improve over the next hour, and she proceeded to walk a few blocks to the hospital. A review of her symptoms was negative. Her medications included aspirin 81 mg and lopressor 25 mg. Our patient denied a history of coronary artery disease, tobacco smoking and alcoholism, a family history of coronary artery disease or invasive cardiovascular procedures. On arrival at 7.02 a.m., the first set of vitals showed a pulse rate of 79, a respiratory rate of 18, blood pressure of 166/87 and oxygen saturation 100% on 2 L via nasal cannula. A physical examination revealed a body mass index (BMI) of 25.3. She was anxious and was in obvious discomfort. The remainder of the examination was unremarkable. An electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm at 77 per minute with normal ST and T wave. A chest X-ray revealed a normal cardiac silhouette. Her baseline troponin was within normal limits. Lopressor, aspirin, and nitroglycerin were administered in the emergency department (ED). However, her pain worsened. The repeat troponin tests at 4-hourly interval trended up from < 0.012 baseline to 0.736 . The repeat EKG did not display any ischemic ST-T wave changes to explain troponin elevation or to account for the degree of pain. A Stat transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) yielded normal left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction and normal wall motion. (The Stat TTE was performed due to the persistent pain being unresponsive to nitroglycerine and morphine.)
Our patient was managed with an ACS protocol with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) 325 mg, plavix 600 mg, full-dose lovenox, lopressor 100 mg, lipitor 80 mg, and underwent emergent cardiac catheterization. On angiogram, no atherosclerotic or stenotic lesion was visualized; however, following the injection of contrast medium, a plexiform network of vessels in the LV wall was demonstrated, followed by a jet of contrast medium entering the left ventricular cavity originating from the distal third of the left anterior descending and diagonal arteries. The plexus was eventually identified as coronary artery microfistulae. All fistulae drained into the left ventricular cavity. The ventriculogram elicited apical ballooning of the left ventricle with preserved function of the remaining myocardium consistent with TCM.
The echocardiogram (ECHO) did not reveal the apical ballooning seen on the ventriculogram likely due to two reasons:
First, because of it was a technically difficult study; second, as the Takotsubo is a transient phenomenon, it is likely that she developed the apical ballooning while being transferred for the cardiac catheterization.
After medical treatment our patient was discharged on metoprolol and aspirin with full resolution of symptoms and remained asymptomatic at 1-month and 6-month follow-up.","

CR_ENG_235,English,"A 58-year-old Thai woman developed end-stage renal disease from lupus nephritis and had been on hemodialysis for 2 years. She had markedly elevated serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) of 113.8 pmol/L (1.6–6.9 pmol/L), increased serum calcium (Ca) of 2.65 mmol/L (2.10–2.37 mmol/L), and a phosphorus (P) level of 1.39 mmol/L (1.13–1.78 mmol/L). She was on Lanthanum carbonate, later converted to aluminum hydroxide, but was not on 1 alpha cholecalciferol, vitamin D analogs or calcium supplements. Daily urine output was 130 mL and her urine pH was high at 7.5 without urinary tract infection or sodium bicarbonate use. On 26 March 2014, our patient received a renal transplant from her haplo-identical and compatible blood group 35-year-old son. The radionuclide renogram demonstrated normal function of both of the donor’s kidneys. Pretransplant luminex crossmatch and panel reactive antibody tests were negative. Parathyroid sestamibi scan was not done because the doctor and patient did not want to do a parathyroidectomy. Cinacalcet (50 mg, once a day), a calcimimetic agent, and aluminum hydroxide (Al(OH)3) (1000 mg, three times a day) were prescribed for 2 days prior to transplantation. Serum Ca, P, and iPTH were decreased to 2.20, 1.74 mmol/L, and 92 pmol/L at the time of transplantation, respectively (Fig. ). Induction therapy consisted of tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and steroid without interleukin-2 receptor antagonists as indicated in institutional protocol.
The patient had immediate graft function with 3000 mL of urine during day 1 after transplantation. However, urine output decreased to 1150 mL on day 2, with serum Ca, P, and iPTH levels increased to 2.33 mmol/L, 1.65 mmol/L, and 137.4 pmol/L, respectively (Fig. ). Serum creatinine (SCr) was significantly elevated to 280 µmol/L on day 4. Doppler ultrasound of the transplanted kidney showed no hydronephrosis or vessel-related problems. Cinacalcet (25 mg) and Al(OH)3 were restarted again on day 2. Intravenous furosemide was also prescribed to enhance urine output. Tacrolimus level were 6.5–11.9 ng/mL. Hemodialysis was started and allograft biopsy was performed on day 2 after transplantation. The graft biopsy contained 25 glomeruli with no presence of glomerulitis or fibrin thrombi. There were, however, more than 20 foci of intratubular basophilic crystals (Fig. a). The crystals were positive for von Kossa stain, indicating calcium phosphate precipitation (Fig. b). Under polarized light, crystals showed no birefringence that is characteristic of calcium oxalate. Interestingly, all of the crystals were located in the distal tubules. There was no evidence of tubular injury or rejection. Immunofluorescence studies for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, lambda, fibrinogen, and C4d were all negative. The histopathological diagnosis was nephrocalcinosis caused by intratubular precipitation of calcium phosphate crystals, most likely due to severe hyperparathyroidism. Urine pH before and 1 day after transplantation was 7.5 and 6.0, respectively. Our patient did not use any phosphate-containing laxatives. We withheld the cinacalcet for 24 h due to a high urine calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) ratio (0.57 mmol/mmol), but restarted later after the ratio was decreased to 0.08 and continued for 1 week without any change in immunosuppressive agents. SCr and iPTH declined to less than 176.8 µmol/L and 21.2 pmol/L, respectively, while serum Ca, P, and urine pH were maintained between 2.10–2.25 mg/dL, 0.87–1.32 mmol/L, and 5.5–6.0, respectively. Only one hemodialysis treatment was required.
At 2 years after transplantation, our patient has slightly high serum iPTH (13.8–21.2 pmol/L) and Ca (2.65 mmol/L) levels, with low level of serum P (0.84 mmol/L). Current immunosuppressive agents include tacrolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, and prednisolone.","

CR_ENG_236,English,"Mr. A, a 57-year-old, single, administrative assistant sought treatment at our hospital almost 30 years ago after seeing a TV show about SAD. He argued being shy and reclusive since early childhood. Mr. A has always been ashamed of performing in front and interacting with other people. His symptoms progressively worsened as he grew up. By adolescence, he started presenting physical symptoms (like tremors, sweat, and heart palpitations) every time he exposed himself to social interactions. Mr. A had never dated until he was 31 years old when he had a brief romantic relationship strictly over the phone. He always lived with his mother.
Despite his qualifications and performance, Mr. A could not remain in the same job for more than 1 year, as he feared his coworker's judgment every time he had to eat in front of them. He also dreaded taking the bus due to being the center of attention while entering public transportations and quit the coding course because of the intense discomfort of having to type in front of people.
During the time Mr. A has been regularly seen in our service, he was treated for his social anxiety symptoms with clonazepam alone or in combination with multiple antidepressants, which were often interrupted because of intolerable side effects. No effective form of psychotherapy was available for him during the follow-up, and his conditions were managed exclusively with pharmacotherapy. Despite claiming he felt less anxious because of the treatment, Mr. A remained severely incapacitated and avoided going out and exposing himself. During this time, he never attained remission status. By the time he was 37 years old, he developed a depressive episode characterized by sadness, anhedonia, insomnia, and weight disturbances. After treatment with nortriptyline 150 mg/day (the only antidepressant he tolerated in a therapeutic dose), his depressive symptoms remitted. However, his social anxiety remained unchanged until age 49, when Mr. A went to a bank to withdraw money. While parking in an alley behind the building, armed assailants jumped out of a car and ambushed him. They hit him in the head with the gun and put him in the car. He was kept hostage for hours before being let go. He thought he would die. Of note, regardless of the emotional and financial injuries caused by the kidnapping, Mr. A never claimed or received any kind of insurance money or benefit because of the event.
Despite the hardship of the situation, Mr. A believes he has handled it well and repeats: “At the end of the day, I'm alive. I feel like a winner.” He denies ever displaying flashbacks of the event, affective distancing/numbing, hypervigilance, or avoidance of situations that remind him of the traumatic event. Further, despite remaining under the same pharmacotherapy scheme and not starting any effective form of psychotherapy during this whole process, his anxiety symptoms drastically improved after the traumatic event, and he finally attained remission status. “I used to care about what other people thought about me and feared their judgment badly. After the kidnapping, this sort of belief feels completely irrelevant,” he claims, “The kidnapping made me realize that the problem was inside of me. I can choose what affects me.”
Sometime after the trauma, Mr. A's salary was cut in half because of financial issues in the company he worked for. His symptoms did not worsen after this, and he says, “because of what happened to me, I'm much stronger. If I were like I was before, I wouldn't be able to handle it. But now I know that if being kidnapped didn't kill me, this won't either.” Still today, years after the traumatic event, Mr. A doesn't fear others' judgment. He eats in front of his coworkers without feeling heart palpitations or sweating and does not avoid social gatherings because of anxiety symptoms. Since the trauma, he has dated more often, has joined the gym, and has moved out of his mother's home. He likes going out and is happier while doing leisure activities. He says that “life is more colorful than before.” depicts periodical assessments of the three dimensions of social anxiety symptoms (physical symptoms, fear and avoidance of social interactions) according to the Social Phobia Inventory (SPIN). As can be noted, there is a sustained improvement in Mr. A's SAD symptoms after the trauma.","

CR_ENG_238,English,"A 48 year-old Chinese woman was first admitted to the hospital two years ago with hematuria, dysuria, urinary frequency and urgency. Anti-nuclear antibody (ANA), anti-Smith antibody, anti-SSA/Ro60 and anti-Ro52 tests were positive. Due to strongly positive anti-SSA/Ro60 and anti-Ro52, salivary gland function was examined in order to eliminate Sjǒgren’s syndrome, although she did not have dry eyes or dry mouth. She was diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and urinary infection, and was treated with hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) and total glucosides of paeony (TGP) maintained for two years after hospital discharge. However, she had repeated episodes of polyarthritis, irregular fever (maximum body temperature of 41 °C) and trichomadesis.
She was admitted again to the hospital due to polyarthritis and fever on August 22, 2017. There was no history of hepatitis, tuberculosis, or diabetes and no previous neurological disturbance. In addition to polyarthritis and fever, splenomegaly was incidentally observed during physical examination upon admission. At this time, her full blood count showed mild pancytopenia (PCP): hemoglobin was 100 g/L, platelet count 85 × 109/L and white blood cell count 3.99 × 109/L. Serum biochemistry tests including hepatic and renal functions were normal, apart from mildly elevated C-reactive protein (12.22 g/L, reference 0.00-9.00 g/L) and reduced albumin (26 g/L, reference 40.0-55.0 g/L). Multiple autoantibodies were positive, including ANA, anti-nucleosome antibody, anti-double stranded DNA, anti-SSA/Ro60, anti-SSB/La and anti-Ro52. Complement 3 was reduced. Coomb’s test and urinary protein were also mildly positive, and urinary total protein was 459.8 mg per 24 h urine. Other investigations for differential diagnosis showed that both rheumatoid factor and anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody were negative, and her prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, procalcitonin and blood culture tests were all normal.
The spectrum of autoimmune liver disease antibodies, hepatitis virus, tumor markers, and ceruloplasmin were negative. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest was normal. Both abdominal ultrasonography (USG) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a wide portal vein (diameter 1.5 cm) and splenomegaly (length 15.5 cm) (Figure ); however, no thrombosis was detected. MRI revealed a heterogeneous hepatic parenchyma signal, which was hyperintense on a T2-weighted image (T2WI). In particular, linear hyperintensity on T2WI was observed around the intrahepatic portal vein. Gastroscopy showed no esophageal or gastric varices. The patient was finally diagnosed with SLE and NCPH, despite her refusal for liver biopsy to confirm histopathology.
She was treated with methylprednisolone 60 mg/d, HCQ 0.4 g/d, metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg/d and supportive treatment. She responded to this treatment and was discharged following post-treatment examination two weeks later. Her serum albumin (35.4 g/L) was elevated, urinary protein was negative, white cell and platelet counts were normal, hemoglobin was 104 g/L, the clinical features of SLE had disappeared and the dose of methylprednisolone was tapered to 32 mg/d. Abdominal USG reexamination of the patient two months later showed that the portal vein (diameter 1.1 cm) and splenomegaly (length 11.7 cm) had diminished. During the course of treatment, she only took the prescribed medicine and had good tolerance, without obvious adverse or unanticipated events. She was maintained on methylprednisolone 20 mg/d, HCQ 0.4 g/d and metoprolol tartrate 12.5 mg/d.
The clinical details of patients with SLE complicated by NCPH are summarized in Table according to the literature review. A total of 22 cases were reported from 1994 to 2017. The ages of these patients ranged from 19 to 56 years. The longest interval between SLE and NCPH in 15 reported cases was 18 years; the other seven cases were not applicable. SLE complicating other diseases was not observed in 45.5% (10/22) of these cases. Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and PCP were observed in 18.2% (4/22) of patients, respectively. No portal thrombosis was detected in any of the patients. Twelve (54.5%) of those patients had hepatic dysfunction according to clinical laboratory tests. During immunological autoantibody measurement, almost all cases (18/22) had a variety of positive autoantibodies, with the exception of four patients. In addition, the majority of patients had nodular regenerative hyperplasia (NRH, 16/22) or portal fibrosis (PF, 5/22) shown by hepatic histopathology. The SLE therapeutic regimen was mainly composed of glucocorticoids (17/22) to control SLE activity, cyclophosphamide/HCQ for PAH, or methotrexate/cyclosporine for PCP.","

CR_ENG_239,English,"Another 54-year-old female presented to our hospital with a chief complaint of high-continuous fever for 1 week. She also had shortness of breath (dyspnea) in the last 7 days and had gradually worsened. She had a productive cough and high-intensity pain in her right leg. At the initial examination, she already had laboratory results with positive PCR result for COVID-19 and a raised D-dimer and fibrinogen. Our patient had many comorbidities such as obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stage 2 hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). She routinely consumed amlodipine 10 mg, ramipril 5 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, metformin 3 × 500 mg, and TSA capsule for COPD. Her initial vital signs suggested that her condition was unstable with tachypnea, tachycardia, elevated blood pressure 140/90 mmHg, and hyperpyrexia. Her peripheral oxygen saturation was 88-90% with non-rebreathing mask 10 L/min. Physical examination revealed no rhonchi and wheezing, yet chest X-ray indicated bilateral peripheral chest infiltrates. In further examinations of her lower extremities, we found tenderness of the right lower foot, weak pulsation at the posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. Distal toes were found to be cyanosed (Fig. ).
Routine blood count (erythrocyte, leukocyte, hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets) was showing within normal limits. Urea and creatinine serum level also indicated normal kidney function. Blood glucose level was also within the normal limit. Conversely, her absolute lymphocyte count was low, and neutrophil-lymphocytes-ratio (NLR) was > 3. Coagulation markers, including (D-dimer) and prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) were dramatically increased. C-reactive protein, one of the markers believed to be associated with the severity of COVID-19 infection, was rapidly increased.
We performed a Doppler ultrasound examination, which was challenging in a pandemic situation. The Doppler ultrasound result showed normal flow velocity and spectrum in the common right femoral arteries (triphasic curve). Nevertheless, we discovered a significant occlusion and thrombus in the distal right popliteal artery, minimal flow in the distal posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis arteries. There was no clear sign of collaterals flow and no evidence of thrombus at vein (deep vein thrombosis).
The patient was hospitalized in the isolation ward with a diagnosis of COVID-19 and acute limb ischemia. She consumed aspilet 80 mg, atorvastatin 20 mg, cilostazol 2 × 100 mg, pentoxifylline 2 × 400 mg, amlodipine 10 mg, and ramipril 5 mg. She was also treated with unfractionated heparin (UFH) IV drip with a target control of 1.5×−2× of aPTT. The patient was prepared for further interventional-thrombolytic therapy; unfortunately, her condition worsened into acute respiratory distress syndrome, and our team decided to go on conservative treatment. She was intubated and ventilated. Two weeks later, her condition deteriorated, and she fell into septic shock. The patient had eventually passed away.","

CR_ENG_242,English,"A 55-year-old female was admitted to hospital due to acute onset of hoarseness, voice fatigue, and effort dyspnea. In the past, the patient was diagnosed with HHT and on admission presented characteristic vascular lesions in the oral cavity (Fig. ). She also reported experiencing a moderate epistaxis at least once per month.
In the outpatient setting, a fiberolaryngoscopy and phoniatric examination were performed. It revealed unchanged mobility and morphology of the right vocal fold and paresis of the left vocal fold in intermediate position (Fig. ). Acoustic voice analysis assessment showed a severe hoarseness with a significant hyperfunction of the neck muscles, short phonation time (approx. 8 seconds), voice speaking pitch average around 200 Hz, voice range restricted from 200 to 350 Hz. CT and MRI of head, neck, and chest were inconclusive and showed no pathologic findings.
As radiological imaging and other tests were inconclusive, the unilateral paresis was treated for 12 months as idiopathic by means of extensive rehabilitation. However, no improvement was observed and the cause of deficiency did not clear up. Due to persistent symptoms, the patient was eventually qualified to type I thyroplasty (medialization). The purpose was to achieve full phonation closure of the glottis and to improve patients’ quality of voice. The choice of the external surgical approach versus endolaryngeal was reasonable due to the size of the glottic gap and much higher risk of bleeding; it could potentially be better controlled during an external approach.
Thyroplasty was performed under a local anesthesia, as the voice improvement was monitored during the procedure. Horizontal incision was made at the lower margin of the thyroid cartilage. Using a drill, a hole (5 x 10 mm) was made in the thyroid cartilage at the level of the vocal folds (Fig. ). An implant, made from a silicone block, was adjusted to the hole. Afterwards, the size and position of prosthesis and functional results were assessed by performing the voice quality and glottic closure assessment during phonation. After the procedure, we recommended the patient to avoid vocal effort or extensive physical activity for about 2 weeks.
There were no major complications during the procedure itself and during postoperative period. The voice quality improved both in perceptual evaluation, GRBAS scale (G3R0B1A1S0 vs G1R0B0AOS0) and acoustic analysis (F0, jitter, shimmer, NHR). After surgery, most parameters defining amplitude and frequency normalized. The Voice Handicap Index (VHI) improved significantly (79 points before surgery vs 15 after surgery). The patient is on regular follow-up in the outpatient setting, and during 1-year follow-up, there was no recurrence of symptoms.","

CR_ENG_243,English,"A 21-year-old Hispanic male was presented to our Occupational Medicine clinic following an injury to his right arm. The patient works as a food service worker and had injured himself while trying to pull a tray out of a tray container when the tray had gotten stuck in the container. The patient lost his control and fell forward, hitting his right elbow with the tray handle. He felt immediate sharp pain in his elbow, associated with swelling and purplish-red bruising/discoloration of the medial side of the elbow and proximal forearm.
The patient reported a history of previous surgical procedure for a benign mass at his right axilla at the age of 4 years. The mass initially was thought to be a lymph node. However, following the procedure, the patient's mother was notified it was a “blood clot” and was removed completely and no need for further investigations.
At age 17, the patient was evaluated by a dermatologist because of a persistent red-purple patch at his right arm and was informed that the patch appears to be a “capillary malformation”, for which laser therapy would be an option. However, both parties decided not to perform laser at that point. The patient had uneventful course since then until one month before his recent injury, when he underwent an excisional biopsy for a right axillary lymph node at an outside hospital. He was told it was a “benign” lymph node and that no further treatment or work up was needed.
The patient was seen at our occupational medicine clinic at the same day of the work-related injury. He described his pain level as 8/10 and sharp. There was an obvious bruise and significant tenderness at the medial side of his right elbow and anteromedial proximal forearm. Conspicuous dilated blood vessels were noted across the right arm and forearm. Multiple red-purplish scattered patches were also found on the patient's arm, anterior and posterior upper chest on the right side []. Per the patient, these patches became more prominent after the injury.
The patient was diagnosed with right upper extremity contusion, and was placed on work restrictions of no use of the right arm. An arm sling was dispensed to allow for forearm rest and elevation to decrease the swelling. He was advised to avoid Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs) due to the risk of bleeding and was indicated to use Acetaminophen only for pain management. He was also recommended to wear compression sleeves for the right upper extremity. Due to significant worsening of the pain, the patient went to the emergency department and Computed Tomography (CT) angiogram of the right upper extremity was performed. The test showed normal arterial flow but multiple interweaving vascular structures on the forearm. Subsequently, he was discharged from the emergency department to follow up with occupational medicine.
The patient was re-evaluated one week after the injury at the occupational medicine clinic, and his pain level decreased to 6/10 during rest, but occasionally flared up to 8/10 when he moved his right upper extremity. The pain also worsened when he applied ice to the swelling area. Additionally, the swelling, tenderness and discoloration had extended to involve the medial (ulnar) aspect of the distal forearm and hand []. The medial side of the wrist, hand and ulnar 3-digits became tender and cold to palpate. Therefore, he was referred to vascular surgery to address this condition, and the same work restrictions for no use of the right upper extremity were indicated.
By the time of the visit at the vascular surgery clinic, a month later, the clinical condition improved substantially. The pain in the elbow and forearm had significantly decreased and the swelling became less prominent. He continued to wear the compression sleeves of the right upper extremity, and applying heating pads as needed. He had been taking acetaminophen only twice per week. The work restrictions were eased to be: no lifting/pulling/pushing or carrying more than 10 pounds with the right arm.
The diagnosis of Klippel-Trenaunay (KT) Syndrome was suspected. MR angiogram of the right upper extremity and chest wall was requested. Multiple vascular malformations were found in the MRI with the largest one was centered around the anterior musculature of the forearm (8.7 × 3.2 × 5.2 cm) and around the triceps muscle (measured 9.3 × 2.7 × 4.4 cm). Prominent vessels were seen also within the ulna and humerus bones. Prominent vessels were also seen throughout the fifth finger with small regional vascular malformations. Another 2.5 × 1.2 cm lesion was found at the lateral side of the right chest wall [].
Because of the patient's persistent pain and the significant size of the vascular malformations, the vascular surgery team decided to perform fluoroscopic-guided sclerotherapy for the vascular malformations of the right upper extremity. Polidocanol 2% was used as sclerosant and the patient tolerated the procedure well.
He was re-evaluated at our occupational medicine clinic, 4 days after the sclerotherapy. He reported slight decrease in the swelling and discoloration in the arm and forearm, however continued to have pain. The patient was placed on further work restrictions of “No lifting, pulling, pushing or carrying more than 5 pounds”, following the procedure. 5 days later, the patient presented to the clinic in with worsening pain and firm swelling at the medial side of the arm. There was an excruciating tenderness at that area, and subsequently the Duplex ultrasound was obtained immediately to evaluate for possible deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The ultrasound was negative for any thrombus and only showed post-sclerotherapy changes. The patient reported significant improvement in his pain and reduction of the size of his limb. He was released back to regular duty without any complications.","

CR_ENG_244,English,"A 21-year-old man with a past medical history of asthma presented with acute worsening shortness of breath overnight with no identifiable trigger. The patient had experienced this symptom for three weeks although less severe initially. He also stated that the symptom was accompanied by cough, chest tightness, and pain across the anterior chest but could not clearly describe the characteristics of the pain. The difficult breathing was worsened with lying flat. He denied any history of smoking. On initial presentation, his vital signs included a temperature of 36.7°C, a blood pressure of 119/83 mmHg, a heart rate of 105 beats/min, respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min, and an oxygen saturation of 97% on room air. The patient was 170.2 cm tall and weighed 57.2 kg and BMI of 19.79 kg/m2. Physical examination revealed a distressed and ill-appearing male. Cardiopulmonary examination was notable for tachycardia, tachypnea, and decreased breath sounds in both upper lung fields. Laboratory results showed mild leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 12.9 × 109 cells/L, 72% neutrophils, and 16% lymphocytes. His hemoglobin level was 16.2 g/dl with a hematocrit of 48.6% and platelet count of 243 × 109 cells/L. The blood biochemical profiles were unremarkable. Chest X-ray (CXR) () showed bilateral large pneumothorax (>2cm) with minimal bilateral pleural effusions and significantly compressed mediastinum.
A diagnosis of SBPSP was made. Chest tubes were placed bilaterally with immediate improvement in breathing and tachycardia. The right- and left-sided chest tubes drained serosanguinous fluids, 5 ml and 10 ml, respectively. Patient's clinical condition continued to improve and a follow-up CXR immediately following the procedures () showed a decrease of pneumothorax in both sides. However, during the hospital course, the chest tubes continued to have an air leak and the follow-up CXR continued to demonstrate residual pneumothorax without full lungs expansion. Computed tomography (CT) scan without contrast of the chest revealed subpleural blebs in both of the upper lobes (). Due to continuous air leak without full lung expansion with conservative management, the patient was referred to thoracic surgery evaluation. One week later, our patient underwent bilateral VATS with apical bleb resection, bilateral pleurectomy, and bilateral doxycycline pleurodesis. Biopsy of the apical blebs and parietal pleura of both lungs showed fibrosis and granulation tissue, negative for any atypical cells suspicious for malignancy or Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

CR_ENG_245,English,"A 23-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with a history of longer than 1 year of fatigue, a dim complexion, and mild anorexia. She had no history of hypertension, heart disease, blood transfusions or surgery. A three-generation pedigree did not reveal a history of hepatitis. She had no jaundice. The results of liver function tests were as follows: alanine aminotransferase 22 U/L, aspartate aminotransferase 25 U/L, gamma glutamyl transferase 36 U/L, alkaline phosphatase 66 U/L, albumin 35 U/L, total bilirubin 24.8 μmol/L and direct bilirubin 10.9 μmol/L. She had a reduced level of cholinesterase (4343 U/L). A viral hepatitis panel was negative. Her serum copper level was also in the normal range. Autoimmune antibody and immunoglobulin screens were negative. Radiological imaging was performed. CT showed a side-to-side portocaval shunt between the splenic and left renal veins (Fig. , arrow). Three-dimensional (3D) vessel reconstruction revealed a normal orientation of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins(Fig. , arrow). The main portal vein was present but slender (Fig. , arrow). The morphology observed was consistent with type II Abernethy malformation. MRI was undertaken to further characterise the disorders in the patient, and cross-sectional MRI images revealed intrahepatic bile duct dilation in the right lobe of the liver (Fig. , arrow) and hepatic fibrosis (Fig. , arrow). CT scans also showed kidney cysts (Fig. , arrow). These findings are consistent with a diagnosis of Caroli’s syndrome. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) also confirmed ectasia of the intrahepatic bile duct (Fig. , white arrow) and common hepatic/bile duct dilation (Fig. , red arrow).
Mutational analysis of the PKHD1 gene was performed to identify any genetic anomalies. Genomic DNA was extracted from the peripheral blood leukocytes of both the patient and her parents. Next-generation (NextGen) sequencing was undertaken. A sequencing library was constructed using an Ion AmpliSeq™ Library Kit 2.0 from Life Technologies. Sequencing was carried out with an Ion Torrent PGM™ 200 Sequencing Kit in an Ion Torrent PGM™ System from Life Technologies, and data analysis was performed using BWA-0.7.12 software with the mem comparison strategy following the Genome Analysis Toolkit best practices developed by the Broad Institute. A heterozygous missense mutation in exon 20 (c.1877A > G, p.Lys626Arg) of PKHD1 was identified in the patient (Fig. ). We further performed a parental analysis in the targeted mutation site via PCR-based exon amplification and direct bidirectional sequencing of both strands of PKHD1 using an ABI 3730XL DNA Analyzer. The same heterozygous missense mutation was identified in the father, and the wild-type genotype was identified in the mother (Fig. ).
A liver biopsy was performed, and it revealed thick fibrous bands containing bile ductular proliferation along with duct dilation (Fig. ). The lobular parenchyma was irregularly shaped and appeared to be separated and surrounded by fibrosis bands, with visible nodules (Fig. ). Based on the radiological imaging, genetic testing and liver biopsy, a diagnosis of type II Abernethy malformation associated with Caroli’s syndrome was made.","

US of the local hospital identified multiple large cystic mass in the liver. She has no history of hepatitis B virus infection. After admission, liver function tests showed slightly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), total bilirubin, and direct bilirubin (Table ). But the values of AFP and CEA were normal. Enhanced CT revealed multiple low density lesions in the right and left lobes with slightly uneven enhanced edge at arterial phase, and further enhanced at portal venous and parenchymal phase, which, however, was still lower than that of liver parenchyma (Figure A).
A US-guided percutaneous liver puncture was undertaken, and SCC was examined microscopically (Figure D, E). The patient had no lesions in lungs, gastrointestinal tract, uterus, or ovaries. Therefore, primary SCC of liver was diagnosed. The patient received transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). Angiography through hepatic artery showed multiple nodular tumors dyeing, which was weak centrally but strong peripherally, in the right lobe (Figure B, C). The hybrid emulsion with 5-fuorouracil (1.5 g), cisplatin (40 mg), adriamycin (60 mg), and lipiodol (15 mL) was injected via the catheter selectively to the right hepatic artery, followed by embolization with polyvinyl alcohol microsphere.

CR_ENG_247,English,"The participant, Ms X, was a 49-year-old South African citizen, with no known medical
history, who had been living and working in a Middle East country. In the latter
part of March 2020, most countries introduced COVID-19 lockdown measures, resulting
in the revoking of travel and working visas. The embassy arranged and funded an
evacuation flight for Ms X and other stranded South Africans in the region. After
return to South Africa, citizens were transported to a government site in
Johannesburg and underwent mandatory 14-day quarantine. Ms X was allocated a
4 × 4 m2 room with bed and amenities with meals and drinks provided.
Military and police personnel monitored the accommodation to ensure persons remained
confined to their rooms. Medical staff were on duty to monitor the general health
status of people. Extracted nasal and oropharyngeal samples for the detection of
COVID-19 were collected by on-call government laboratory staff. Individuals received
their test results from the in-house medical personnel. Given the rapid spread of
the virus and the urgent need and priority for screening in communities at the time,
the repatriated citizens could only be tested in the latter part of the quarantine
and, Ms X could only be tested on Day 14.
Ms X provided self-reported height (1.65 m) and weight (68 kg) on Day 1. A cloth
measuring tape was made available to measure waist and hip circumferences daily
using standard procedures. Circumferences were recorded by Ms X, and body mass index
(BMI) was calculated as kg/m2 and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) was
calculated as waist (cm)/height (cm). Daily dietary intake and beverage consumption
was diarised and converted to macronutrients (calories, fats, carbohydrates, protein
and dietary fibre) using an online conversion application ().
The short-form health survey (SF-36) was completed online () to determine physical health
(physical function, role-physical, bodily pain and general health) and mental health
(vitality, role-emotional, social function and vitality). Scores ranged from 0 to
100 with higher scores indicating enhanced overall physical and mental health
(). Night-time sleep (hours/night)
and estimated sitting time per day were recorded by the study participant.
Ms X followed online curated moderate-to-vigorous home-based/indoor exercise videos
requiring no equipment with intermittent stepping during the 14-day quarantine
period. The type of exercises performed included continuous aerobic activity,
high-intensity interval training and resistance training using body weight. A
wireless heart rate (HR) monitor (MZ-3; Myzone Ltd, Isle of Man) was worn during
physical exercise and activity. Physiological measures, including peak and average
HR, calories expended and exercise intensity (%max) were monitored in real time on a
smartphone application and saved on a cloud-based facility (Myzone Ltd., Isle of
Man). The number of steps per day and duration spent stepping were recorded using
the iPhone Health application on the participant’s personal iPhone.
Ms X remained asymptomatic and tested negative for COVID-19 on Day 14. The
self-reported height (1.65 m) and weight (68 kg) did not change since Day 1. The BMI
was 25.0 kg/m2, classified as ‘overweight’ or BMI ⩾ 25 kg/m2, while waist circumference (82 cm) and hip circumference (102 cm) were
constant throughout the 14 days. The WHtR was 0.497, which is just below 0.5, the
cut-point for abdominal obesity.
The average resting HR was 63.8 b/min, ranging from 58 to 73 b/min, while average
night-time sleep was 8.4 h/night. Caloric intake fluctuated, with peaks in caloric
consumption on the second and fourth quarantine days that ranged from 1617 to
2854 kcal/day ().
Energy contribution from macronutrient intake during the 14-day period was provided
mostly by carbohydrates, contributing around 40%–54% to total dietary energy intake
on most days, followed by fats (25%–45% of energy) and proteins (15%–25% of energy).
Added sugars contributed 4.4%–12.5% of energy per day. The overall quality of life
outcomes were initially low and improved towards the end of the quarantine ().
Ms X did not participate in physical exercise or walking everyday (). Total sitting time
was an average of 516 min/day, ranging from 7 to 10 h/day. Time spent stepping
ranged from 20 to 49 min/day, spread over the course of each day. However, 10
exercise sessions were completed, with an average effort of 71.8 %Effort/session
(62–81 %Effort), average duration of 46.9 min/session (15–75 min/session) and
average caloric expenditure of 366 calories expended/session (79–591 calories
expended/session).
The total time spent in physical activity was 7.82 h over the 14-day period. Physical
exercise was completed at a moderate intensity using a mobile application which
provided real-time feedback.","

CR_ENG_248,English,"A 61-year-old female smoker with history of hypercholesterolaemia presented via the pPCI pathway with sudden onset of shortness of breath, dizziness and chest pain while walking. Her electrocardiogram (ECG) revealed ST elevation inferiorly and V1–V3 with transient right bundle branch block (RBBB) and junctional bradycardia (). She was loaded with Aspirin 300 mg, Ticagrelor 180 mg orally on presentation, and then regular doses of Aspirin 75 mg daily, Ticagrelor 90 mg b.i.d. with prophylactic dose Enoxaparin 40 mg daily in line with our hospital’s pPCI protocol.
Transradial coronary angiography revealed a normal left main coronary artery, large left anterior descending artery that wrapped around the apex and a dominant left circumflex artery with non-obstructive disease (, Videos S1 and S7). The RCA was not visualized and subsequently engaged despite multiple attempts using a variety of diagnostic catheters (). A left ventriculogram showed normal left ventricle (LV) systolic function (). Physical examination revealed an elevated jugular venous pressure, clear lung fields, normal heart sounds with a pansystolic murmur, and signs of hypoperfusion.
Her National Early Warning Score (NEWS) was 10 based on respiratory rate of 27/min, oxygen saturation of 88% (room air), temperature 35.9˚C, blood pressure 98/54 mmHg, and pulse rate of 53 beats/min with signs of hypoperfusion and oliguria (initial serum lactate of 2.5 mmol/L, urine output of <0.5 mL/kg/h within the first 4 h, respectively). She was started on oxygen therapy (4 L/min via nasal cannula) and intravenous dobutamine at a rate of 2.5 µg/kg/min and repeat haemodynamic observation after 30 min revealed a NEWS score of 4 based on respiratory rate of 20 per minute, oxygen saturation of 94% (on oxygen), temperature 36.6˚C, blood pressure 120/67 mmHg, and pulse rate of 69 beats/min.
She was in cardiogenic shock with a persistent ectopic atrial rhythm with retrograde p-waves indicative of ventriculoatrial conduction, present (), but stabilized with intravenous dobutamine thus avoiding the need for a transcutaneous venous pacing system. Using Fridericia correction, her QTc 479 ms which was prolonged () became normalized upon discharge. A bedside transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) revealed a normal LV size and function (ejection fraction > 55%), leftward systolic septal wall motion suggestive of right-sided pressure overload and moderate RV dilatation (basal RV diameter of 44 mm). Right ventricular systolic function was severely impaired with a tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) of 5 mm and free wall akinesis. There was severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) with evidence of flow reversal in the hepatic veins and the estimated RV systolic pressure, based on the TR gradient and estimated right atrial pressure, was 45.76 mmHg (right atrial pressure 10 mmHg) (, Videos S8 and S9).
Admission bloods revealed a normocytic anaemia with a haemoglobin 109 g/L (normal range 115–165 g/L), raised white cell count 16.2 × 109/L (normal range 4.0–10.0 × 109/L) and C-reactive protein 55.1 mg/L (normal value <5 mg/L). High sensitivity cardiac Troponin T level was elevated from 46 to 1998 (normal value <14 ng/L), with a N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level of 3550 ng/L (normal value <263 ng/L).
Arterial blood gas analysis showed a pH 7.51 (normal range 7.35–7.45), pO2 7.0 kPa (normal range 10–14 kPa), pCO2 4.20 kPa (normal range 4.5–6 kPa), lactate 1.4 mmol/L (normal range 0.5–2.2 mmol/L), HCO3¯ 27.8 mmol/L (normal range 22–26 mmol/L) with an oxygen saturation 94.4% on 4 L of oxygen via nasal cannula indicating hypoxic respiratory failure with alkalosis.
The differential diagnoses included massive pulmonary embolism (PE), bradycardia with haemodynamic disturbance, right ventricular myocarditis, and isolated right ventricular myocardial infarction (RVMI).
Her chest radiograph was normal, computed tomography pulmonary angiogram demonstrated no evidence of PE, an urgent cardiac gated computed tomography (, ) revealed a recessive RCA with ostial occlusive lesion. A cardiac MRI was performed once the patient had stabilized demonstrated a normal RV end-diastolic volume (78 mL/m2), an elevated RV end-systolic volume (42 mL/m2) with an ejection fraction of 46% with marked regional wall motion abnormality along the RV free wall coupled with extensive late gadolinium contrast enhancement, consistent with infarction (, , and ). A departmental agitated saline TTE study, performed prior to the MRI, revealed the presence of a patent foramen ovale but this was not haemodynamically significant on MRI. Left ventricular systolic function was normal across all imaging modalities.
She was managed conservatively and discharged to her local district general hospital (DGH) after 5 days in our tertiary centre. She had a nocturnal sinus pause lasting 5 s on telemetry at Day 10 post-index presentation. Multi-disciplinary device team discussion felt there was not enough of an indication to proceed to a permanent pacing system. She was enrolled in a cardiac rehabilitation programme and discharged home on Aspirin, Ticagrelor (b.i.d. for 12 months), Atorvastatin, Spironolactone, and Lansoprazole with plan for an outpatient follow-up.","

CR_ENG_249,English,"A 48-year-old female with history of hypertension, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and right-sided nephrolithiasis experienced right-flank severe colicky pain with nausea and non-bloody vomiting within 24 hours post-urology intervention of right ureteroscopy with laser lithotripsy, stone extraction, and double-J stent placement. The patient’s symptoms were secondary to the displacement of a ureteral stent that resulted in spontaneous expulsion of the stent with subsequent mild improvement of symptoms. However, the patient then developed shaking, chills, and a fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F) associated with lethargy and weakness. The patient denied urinary, respiratory, or other symptoms, and a chart review indicated the patient had been discharged home post-surgery on a prophylactic regimen of 100 mg nitrofurantoin administered twice daily.
On examination, the patient appeared lethargic and had dry oral mucous membranes. Abdominal exam revealed a soft, non-distended abdomen with mild right flank discomfort. Chest auscultation was clear except for bibasilar mild crackles. Vitals were normal except for mild tachycardia. Lab work showed leukocytosis of 19,000 cells/µL (normal: 4,000-11,000/µL) with elevated lactic acid of 2.5 mmol/L (normal lactic acid: <2.0 mmol/L), serum creatinine (SCr) of 1.3 mg/dL (baseline SCr: 1.0 mg/dL), and elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN) of 26 mg/dL. In addition, PCL and CRP levels were elevated to 25.5 ng/mL and 39.3 mg/dL, respectively, indicating a bacterial infection. Urinalysis was unremarkable for infection or hematuria. To evaluate flank pain, a computed tomography (CT scan) of the abdomen and pelvis without contrast was performed which revealed multiple small calculi in both kidneys with mild right hydronephrosis, ureteral edema, and stranding of the right kidney and collecting system suggesting reactionary changes due to recent instrumentation versus possible infection (Figure ). Since the patient was on a prophylactic nitrofurantoin regimen, we presumed that urinalysis with no pyuria was secondary to the use of nitrofurantoin, and due to recent urinary tract intervention, right kidney and ureteral inflammation on CT scan, a urinary source of infection was highly suspected as contributing to the clinical condition. After taking urine cultures and blood cultures, the patient was initiated on an empiric regimen of intravenous piperacillin-tazobactam at 3.375 gm every 8 hours, and nitrofurantoin was discontinued.
Within 24 hours of admission, the patient developed mild dry cough, a fever of 38.89°C (102°F), and chills associated with transient hypoxia with a pulse oximetry desaturation to 86% requiring 1 L nasal cannula oxygen to maintain normal oxygenation. A chest radiograph revealed an asymmetric left suprahilar density and right infrahilar density consistent with atelectasis, aspiration, or multifocal pneumonia (Figure ).
Comprehensive respiratory viral panel, urine Legionella, and streptococcal pneumonia antigen were negative. Sputum cultures could not be taken because of nonproductive cough. Preliminary urine cultures and blood cultures revealed no growth. Due to atypical presentation of pulmonary symptoms, follow-up CT angiography of the chest revealed no evidence of pulmonary emboli. The ground glass opacities were present throughout both lungs with small bilateral pleural effusions and adjacent bibasilar atelectasis (Figure ).
Pulmonary imaging findings were out of proportion to the clinical condition of the patient. Urology and infectious disease physicians evaluated the patient, and it was considered that nitrofurantoin use was contributing to acute onset of bilateral multifocal pulmonary infiltrates leading to mild transient cough and transient pulse oximetry desaturation associated with physiological systemic inflammatory stress response as evidenced by fever, leukocytosis, and significantly elevated PCL and CRP. After the third day of hospitalization, the piperacillin-tazobactam regimen was discontinued, and the patient was observed off all antibiotics. The patient continued to improve without antibiotics and did not require supplemental oxygen with resolution of symptoms within the next three days. We determined that inflammatory findings present in imaging of the right kidney and collecting system were likely secondary to recent urological instrumentation with laser lithotripsy while the transient right-sided flank pain was probably secondary to displacement of the ureteral stent leading to ureteral colic. Serum inflammatory markers continued to improve without antibiotics after cessation of nitrofurantoin use with decreases in serum PCL and CRP levels from admission to discharge day specifically 25.5 ng/mL to 2.1 ng/mL and 39.3 mg/dL to 14.5 mg/dL, respectively. The patient was discharged after six days of hospitalization, and it was strongly recommended the patient avoid use of nitrofurantoin in the future to prevent recurrence of pulmonary toxicity. The patient continues to have a stable clinical condition after discharge and no complications have been reported since then.","

The patient was in good general conditions and had normal vital signs (blood pressure: 125/65 mmHg, regular heart rate: 84 beats/minute). He had a temperature of 100.4°F (38°C). Cardiovascular examination revealed a systolic heart murmur 2/6 at the mesocardium. The pharynx was normal and minimal acne was observed on the skin. Blood tests indicated neutrophilic leukocytosis (white blood cell count: 13x 103/µL; neutrophils: 9.7x103/µL) as well as elevated lactate dehydrogenase (266 mU/mL) and C reactive protein (CRP; 18 mg/dL). The urine analysis was negative for infection. The electrocardiography (ECG) demonstrated sinus tachycardia, and the chest x-ray was normal. A bone marrow aspirate was performed to exclude hematological malignancies. Two sets of blood cultures were drawn, and empirical treatment with amoxicillin/clavulanate plus vancomycin was started. Blood cultures were found to be positive for gram-positive cocci in chains, which were later identified as streptococcus group A (Streptococcus pyogenes). The patient was admitted to the Infectious Disease Department and ceftriaxone (2g, twice daily) plus ampicillin (12g/day) were started. The transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) documented moderate mitral regurgitation and multiple mobile filamentous structures attached to the posterior mitral leaflet (PML) of 1.1 cm in length suggestive of vegetation (Figure -).
The hemodynamic stability of the patient (he had normal values for atrial natriuretic peptide and no signs of heart failure) and the short course of antibiotic treatment were the reasons for not performing urgent surgery on the mitral valve after consultation with cardiac surgeons. Gentamicin (3mg/kg daily) was started instead of ceftriaxone on day seven. His abdominal ultrasonography was negative for liver or splenic embolisms. Painful erythematous nodules (2 to 3mm) were observed on the skin of the right sole, suggestive of secondary lesions. No other skin lesions appeared during the following days, and the neurological examination was steadily normal. The patient underwent weekly ECG evaluations during antibiotic treatment.
A second TEE done on the 12th day of antibiotic therapy found worsening of the endocarditis and growth of the vegetative lesions on the PML. On the 14th day, a cardiac magnetic resonance scan excluded either concomitant rheumatic heart disease or peri-valvular abscess due to Streptococcus pyogenes. At the ECG exams on the 19th and 25th days of hospitalization, the vegetant lesions were not observed (Figure G-I). Gentamicin treatment was continued for two weeks, ampicillin for four weeks, and then the patient was discharged. At the clinical control checkup six months later, the patient was asymptomatic with normal vital signs. A blood test revealed normal white blood cells (WBC) count and CRP levels. Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) showed a low-grade mitral insufficiency consistent with previous endocarditis of posterior commissure of the mitral valve with normal left ventricular ejection fraction.","

CR_ENG_252,English,"A 57-year-old male presented with complaints of low grade fever for 10 days; dry cough, progressive breathlessness and right-sided chest pain of seven days duration. There was no history of wheezing or hemoptysis. There was no past history of any cardiac illness, pulmonary tuberculosis, COPD, blood transfusion or previous hospitalization. The patient gave history of diabetes mellitus diagnosed 10 years back and presently well-controlled on oral hypoglycemic agents. He was also a known hypertensive for seven years, well-controlled with drugs.
On physical examination, the patient was conscious and alert with a pulse rate of 110 beats per minute, blood pressure of 140/70 mmHg, and a respiratory rate of 36 breaths per minute. The accessory respiratory muscles were active. The patient was febrile with temperature 100.8°F. There was no pallor, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, icterus, cyanosis, or pedal edema. Examination of the chest revealed reduced movements on right side, and stony dull note in right infrascapular, infra-mammary and axillary regions with decreased breath sounds. Rest of the physical examination was unremarkable.
Investigations showed hemoglobin-10.9 gm%, total leukocyte count-11,400/cu mm, differential leukocyte count-P78 L06 M5 E11, erythrocyte sedimentation rate -38 mm, random blood sugar-505 mg%, blood urea-89 mg%, serum creatinine-2.3 mg%, serum proteins-5.4 gm%, albumin-2.8 gm%, alanine aminotransferase-128 IU/l, aspartate aminotransferase-142 IU/l. Urine routine examination showed albumin in traces and sugar-4+ and ketones were absent. Electrocardiograph showed sinus tachycardia. Arterial blood gases were suggestive of uncompensated metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.297, partial pressure of carbon dioxide: 23 mmHg, partial pressure of oxygen: 119 mmHg, bicarbonate: 10.9 mEq/L) which might have been due to severe sepsis. His chest radiograph [] showed right pleural effusion. A diagnostic thoracocentesis was performed and thin pus was aspirated. Pleural fluid cell count was 4200 (P-73%, L-18%, M-09%), glucose: 134 mg%, protein: 5.2 gm%, and lactate dehydrogenase: 1621 IU/l. Acid fast bacilli (AFB) smear and Gram's stain were negative, and pyogenic culture was sterile.
Early initiation of a combination of empirical intravenous antibiotics, amoxycillin-clavulanic acid and cefepime, was started. Inter-costal chest tube drainage was done and about 1500 ml thin pus drained. Even after four days of treatment there was no clinical improvement as fever persisted and patient remained tachypnoeic, toxic, febrile and breathless. Inter-costal drainage of about 150-200 ml of thin pus was noted daily. Chest ultrasonography (USG) was suggestive of right multi-loculated empyema. Contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of chest showed right sided empyema with multiple loculations but no pleural thickening. There was no mediastinal lymphadenopathy or lung parenchymal involvement. Mantoux test was negative. Medical thoracoscopy was performed and another 750 ml of thin pus aspirated. A large number of fibrinous adhesions with multiple loculations were seen. Diaphragm and pleural surfaces were lined with fibrinous exudates. Pleural fluid and pleural biopsy specimens were sent for pyogenic, fungal and AFB culture. Pleural fluid smears[] showed septate fungal hyphae. Intravenous voriconazole was started with a loading dose of 400 mg twice on first day followed by 200 mg twice daily. He was taken up for surgical intervention due to persistent toxemia and multiloculated empyema. Thoracotomy revealed tough fibrinous adhesions with multiloculated fluid collection with pleural thickening. The right lower lobe showed multiple superficial cavitatory lesions measuring one-two cms. Complete parietal pleurectomy was done along with surgical resection of part of the right lower lobe. Pleural fluid, pleural and lung tissue cultures grew Aspergillus fumigatus, whereas the bacterial cultures and AFB smears were negative in all the samples. The hematoxyllin and eosin staining of pleural biopsy sample was positive for aspergillar hyphae []. The postoperative period was uneventful and he was continued with voriconazole. His general condition improved rapidly. The toxemic state, fever and breathlessness subsided. His kidney function tests settled to normal. The patient was discharged after 14 days on oral Voriconazole which was continued for three months. He was followed up to eight months and showed good clinical and radiological recovery.","

CR_ENG_253,English,"The following case is of a 66-year-old man with a complicated cardiac history, who for some time has been experiencing limiting angina despite being on maximally titrated medical therapy of aspirin, prasugrel, carvedilol, ranolazine, isosorbidemononitrate (sustained release), atorvastatin, lisinopril, nitroglycerin patch, and as needed sublingual nitroglycerin. His cardiac history includes extensive coronary artery disease (CAD). 
Status post coronary artery bypass graft 15 years ago (CABG: reverse saphenous vein graft to first and second obtuse marginal arteries in a sequential fashion and reverse saphenous vein graft to posterior descending artery and posterolateral artery in a sequential fashion) Status post redo CABG 2 years ago (CABG: left internal mammary artery [LIMA] to the left anterior descending artery [LAD]) Status post multiple stents
He also has a history of hypertension, diabetes (on metformin), dyslipidemia, and prior bilateral carotid endarterectomy. He was evaluated by cardiothoracic surgery 8 months prior, and they recommended against reoperation.
About 4 months prior, he underwent another coronary angiography. This angiogram showed a relatively long 95% stenosis in the mid-LAD. The stenosis extended from the mid-LAD to a bit passed the LIMA anastomosis, with retrograde flow into the LIMA (). Some tenting of the LAD at the anastomotic site was also noted. Several predilations were performed at 8 and 10 atmospheres with no significant improvement to the stenosis. A 2.25 × 28 mm Synergy drug-eluting stent (Boston Scientific) was then deployed at 12 atmospheres and postdilated with 2.25 × 20 mm noncompliant balloon at 14 atmospheres. The stent was successfully deployed in the mid-LAD with no residual stenosis. A slight kink in the distal one-third of the stent at the LIMA insertion point was noted (). further demonstrates the movement of the intact stent during diastole and systole. The patient's symptoms temporarily improved.
A short time after, he presented again with rest pain. His vital signs were stable. Physical examinations, including cardiac exams, were unimpressive. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed normal sinus rhythm without significant ST/T changes. Two troponin levels drawn 12-hour apart were both normal. Repeat coronary angiography was performed. It revealed a mid-LAD stent fracture with 70% in-stent restenosis (fractional flow reserve of 0.78) (). Coronary intervention was performed and a Xience Alpine DES was deployed inside the fractured Synergy DES with TIMI III flow and no residual stenosis (). The patient tolerated the procedure and was discharged in stable condition.","

CR_ENG_254,English,"A 27-year-old woman was discovered to have a giant retroperitoneal tumor incidentally during her routine obstetric examination at 16 weeks of gestation. Ultrasonographies demonstrated a giant left retroperitoneal tumor measuring 21 × 8 cm that extended from the lower border of the left kidney to the left pelvis. An abdominal routine MRI revealed the giant left retroperitoneal tumor, measuring 16 × 9 cm that extended from the hilum of the left kidney to the left pelvis, the lesion had a close relation with the psoas and iliopsoas, and the left kidney and uterus were compressed laterally. There was no liver metastasis and urinary system and major vessel involvement (Figures and ). All tumor markers were within normal range.
Core needle aspiration was not performed because the lesion was so consistent with liposarcoma in MRI. The patient was a young woman with firm willing for preserving the fetus. After thorough consultation with radiologist, obstetrician, urologist, and anesthesiologist, considering the MRI revealed no clear evidence of major organ and vessel involvement, and the patient was in her second trimester, we decided to perform the en bloc resection with an attempt for fetus preservation.
The laparotomy was performed with left paramedian incision under general anesthesia at 20 weeks of gestation. The giant retroperitoneal tumor located in the left retroperitoneal space extended from the hilum of the left kidney to the left pelvis, without involvement of adjacent muscle, kidney, intestine, and major vessels. The en bloc resection was accomplished with negative surgical margin. The operation lasts 3 h, and intraoperative hemorrhage was 450 ml, with transfusion of 2 u of packed red blood cell. Fetal heart rate under perioperative ultrasonography monitoring ranged from 130 to 150 bpm. Retodrine was administered until 1 week postoperatively. The patient had an uneventful recovery. The final pathology demonstrated a low-grade myxoid liposarcoma with negative surgical margin, mitotic index 5/50 HPF. IHC results showed the following: desmin (−), Ki-67 (<15%), NF (−), vimentin (+), S-100 (−), SMA (−), MyoD1 (−), CD34 (−), CD117 (−), NeuN (−), P16 (−), HMB45 (−), CD68 (−), CD31 (−), calretinin (−), calponin (−) (Figure ).

CR_ENG_256,English,"A 14-year-old female was referred by her paediatrician in outpatient clinic on 30 January 2018 for an elective hospital admission on 1 February, 2018. She was referred because she had recently lost weight; was complaining of a 2-week history of intermittent epigastric abdominal pain; and, upon investigation, the paediatrician found that she had an iron deficiency anaemia and an epigastric/left upper quadrant mass was found on clinical examination. She had lost 1 kg of weight in the past week, but had a normal appetite. The abdominal pain was not associated with nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea or other constitutional symptoms. She had noticed some dark stools, (consistent with her being on Ferrograd C) and a slight reduction in her exercise tolerance, but felt well within herself.
She had been seen in the paediatric outpatient clinic due to her history of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Other relevant past history includes delayed puberty and poor growth, with poor weight and height gain in the past 3 years. Further history revealed that she had been suffering from the abdominal mass and abdominal pain for approximately a year, having had roughly 3–4 episodes during this time. An abdominal ultrasound was ordered in June 2017 to investigate, which showed no abnormalities, apart from a small left kidney. The girl’s medications included Hydrocortisone, Fluticasone and Ferrograd C. Her mother provided consent for medical imaging and procedures.
On admission, physical examination revealed a firm and non-tender mass in the epigastric and left upper quadrant region. Her abdomen was mildly distended, but soft and non-tender. Examinations of her heart and lungs revealed no abnormalities. Additionally, there was no evidence of mouth ulcers, skin changes, obvious alopecia or eye irritation. Her weight was 34.6 kg and height 146 cm (first percentile). Her vital signs showed no significant abnormalities. The differential diagnosis at this stage was thought to be of spleen pathology. The plan on admission was for laboratory investigations, stool tests, commence an iron infusion, an abdominal ultrasound and chest radiograph. On admission (1 February 2018) her abnormal blood tests showed: Hb 76 g l−1 (L), MCV 67fL (L), Albumin 32 g l−1 (L), Ferritin <5 ug l−1 (L) and ESR 25 mm hr–1 (H). Extensive urine, stool and blood tests (including autoimmune, endocrine, infective and vitamin testing) were all negative.
Abdominal ultrasound on the 1 February 2018 showed grossly enlarged lymph nodes at the left upper quadrant, free intraperitoneal fluid at the right iliac fossa and an atrophic left kidney with cystic changes in the lower pole. The paediatric team requested a second read, which found a prominent bowel with the cause of the findings unclear. The report conclusion stated that these findings were atypical for mesenteric adenitis and CT or MRI would be appropriate. However, on ultrasound, both radiologists missed the finding of a large thick and curved echogenic band with posterior acoustic shadowing (), which is typical of a trichobezoar. This diagnosis needs to be differentiated from other differentials including food remains, barium concretions (if used) and bile ileus. Given the initial abdominal ultrasound findings, a chest radiograph was requested to check for mediastinal lymphadenopathy. The chest radiograph was reported by the radiologist as having no evidence of mediastinal lymphadenopathy or any other pathology. However, the radiologist missed the subtle evidence of a trichobezoar on plain chest radiography. It is seen as a curvilinear shadow below (), and projecting into the gastric air bubble. This finding could easily have been confused for normal food contents. Later that evening, a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis with i.v. contrast was performed (). This showed a grossly distended stomach filled by a suspected solid content, surrounded by a rim of gas, occupying as much as 13 × 6 × 6 cm in size. Additionally, mild to moderate free fluid and adjacent perigastric nodes anteriorly were found with no obvious duodenal lesion found. The suspected diagnosis was a gastric bezoar. The following day the patient admitted to pulling/playing with her hair and eating a substantial amount of hair as a child, but denied having consumed any for years. The gastroenterology team were consulted and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy was organised later that day. This showed a large gastric trichobezoar with an associated gastric ulcer on the lesser curve of the stomach. The duodenum appeared unremarkable to the D2 segment. The general surgical team were subsequently consulted and she underwent a laparotomy, gastrotomy and retrieval of the trichobezoar on the 3 February 2018.
She recovered uneventfully post-operatively, being discharged from hospital after 4 days. Her last bloods before discharge were on 5 February 2018, which showed a Hb of 86 (L), MCV 73 (L), Alb 26 (L). She was discharged with nil issues from the general surgical outpatient clinic after her first visit 3 weeks post-discharge from hospital. On her most recent paediatric outpatient appointment on the 17 April 2018, she had been very well, with increased energy, exercise tolerance and her blood results had normalised.","

CR_ENG_257,English,"A 22 year old right handed female was referred to Neurology outpatients with a three year history of lower limb cramping relieved by movement and involuntary nocturnal lower limb movements. She was able to suppress the movements but this increased discomfort. Initially, there was a brief and non-sustained response to a dopamine agonist (pramipexole commencing at 0.18 mg daily up titrated to 2 g three times a day). In addition, she reported painful involuntary pulling sensation in her head and trunk. Past medical history was unremarkable and there was no history of Dystonia or Parkinsonism in her two sisters, parents or grandparents. No identifiable triggers including trauma or neuroleptic use were identified. Over the next two months, these symptoms rapidly progressed and the patient was admitted for assessment. Examination at that time revealed hyperkinetic movements comprising of extensor posturing in the upper limbs, severe retrocollis and retropulsion of the neck and torso. There was no notable diurnal variation. There was no evidence of Parkinsonism, pyramidal or cerebellar dysfunction. Deep tendon reflexes were brisk and symmetrical with downgoing plantars. There was no clinical response during a period of direct observation with inpatient neurology and physiotherapy assessment to a low dose of Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) 10 mg/100 mg three times a day (TID). Her symptoms continued to progress and two months later, the patient was unable to mobilise independently or lie flat.
A Dystonia and Parkinsonism Next Generation Sequencing panel was requested and revealed a heterozygous point mutation GCH1gene c.305T>A with a Met102Lys protein change. This mutation has previously been reported with Autosomal Dominant Dopa-Responsive Dystonia []. CSF biomarkers revealed low levels of biotetrahypterin and total neopterin which supported a defect in GTP-cyclohydrolase. She was retrialled on a higher dose of Carbidopa-Levodopa (Sinemet) 30 mg/300 mg TID with complete resolution of symptoms (total daily levodopa dose 900 mg). At two year follow up, the patient remains asymptomatic on the same dose. The medication is well tolerated without adverse effects and the patient has an excellent quality of life.","

CR_ENG_258,English,"A 70-year-old male of previous excellent health presented with haematuria and was found to have T2 N1 TCC of the bladder. He underwent four cycles of neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine and cisplatin without complication and was shown to have had a good response. He was felt to be inoperable owing to the node-positive state and was therefore considered for radiotherapy.
The patient received 64 Gy in 32 fractions to the bladder and positive nodes. A prophylactic dose of 53 Gy in 32 fractions was delivered to the bilateral pelvic nodes. No concurrent chemotherapy was given.
The patient tolerated therapy without significant problems although he reported mild diarrhoea for which he did not require medication.
This patient’s follow-up CT scan unfortunately showed retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. A CT PET scan was performed to see if this was solitary metastatic disease and therefore to assess his suitability for salvage therapy. Unfortunately, the CT PET scan, performed 5 months after treatment, showed extensive retrocrural and supraclavicular lymphadenopathy. Eight months after completing radical treatment he continues on palliative carboplatin and gemcitabine therapy.

CR_ENG_259,English,"An 83-year-old man with a past medical history of two myocardial infarctions, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and hyperlipidemia presented to the emergency room shortly before midnight with sharp chest pain, nausea, and dyspnea. The patient states he has had chest discomfort and food intolerance for the past week, but that his symptoms were far worse tonight. He notes no inciting event, recent trauma, or aggravating factors. On exam he appears uncomfortable, anxious, and is in a semi-tripod position. Vitals are pertinent for a heart rate of 144, systolic blood pressure in the 180 s, and oxygen saturation of 89% on 1L O2 via nasal cannula. Of note, the patient weighed 67.2 kg, and was 173 cm tall. Chart review showed that he had lost approximately 4 kg (last recorded weight in chart was 71.2 kg), since his last medical visit.
Primary survey was overall unremarkable. Airway was secure, patient’s breathing improved with 3 L oxygen, breath sounds were present and equal bilaterally, vascular access was obtained, and GCS was 15. Intravenous pain medication was given which improved the patient’s blood pressure to systolic 140 s. Given this patient’s overall clinical picture, the most pressing disease processes included myocardial infarction (given history of coronary artery disease and prior infarcts), aortic dissection (given symptoms, hypertension, and medical history), pneumothorax, pulmonary embolism (the previous two diagnoses given his chest pain and decreased O2 even on 1 L of oxygen), and cardiac wall rupture (given multiple prior MIs). Other considerations include congestive heart failure, hypertensive crisis, and an underlying infection.
Labs were drawn to include a CBC, renal panel, cardiac panel, lactate, and a type and cross. EKG was unremarkable. A chest X-ray was obtained which revealed a widened mediastinum (Fig. ).
The patient was stabilized, but the underlying cause of his symptoms had not yet been identified. His widened mediastinum is troubling, and further drives the differential. Aortic (dissection, aneurysm), cardiac (tamponade, wall rupture), and esophageal pathology (rupture versus other masses) now move to the top of the list of diagnoses. Labs continued to be pending. Given his now overall hemodynamically stable status and clinical improvement, the decision was made to obtain a CT chest/abdomen/pelvis which revealed the following (Fig. ).
Along with the CT scan; the initial set of labs resulted and were pertinent for leukocytosis (white blood cell count/WBC) of 19,000/mcL, creatinine of 1.4 mg/dL, lactate of 3.94 mmol/L, and troponin of 0.101 ng/mL. Although no official read of the images were immediately available, a preliminary read by the team was concerning for mega-esophagus versus a strangulated hiatal hernia. Treatment of the pathology to limit the degree of heart strain (increased troponin), ischemia (as evidenced by the WBC and lactate), and possibility for future perforation were now the primary goals. Night Hawk radiology was contacted for an emergent read, who stated that the images were consistent with a severely dilated esophagus. No pulmonary emboli were visualized, and no other acute abnormalities were reported.
The findings, treatment modalities, risks, and benefits were discussed in depth with the patient. Given his dilated esophagus which was severe enough to cause him chest pain, dyspnea, alter his vitals, elevate his WBC, elevate lactate levels, and cause heart strain. Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) with possible video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS), possible thoracotomy, possible laparoscopy, and possible laparotomy were recommended to the patient. The goal was for direct visualization of area, decompression, and repair of any defects. The patient was in full agreement with the plan, and was taken to the operating room shortly thereafter. In the mean time, given the location of the pathology and concern for developing septic picture, the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics and an antifungal.
On EGD, the patient’s esophageal distention was found to be from a large bezoar which spanned from the broncho-aortic region of the esophagus to his lower esophageal sphincter. The bezoar was a phytobezoar, with evidence of medication and food particles (meat, vegetables) incorporated into it. The esophageal tissue appeared tenuous and appeared to be the cause of the patient’s lab derangements (Fig. ).
The decompression was done carefully and meticulously by fragmenting the bezoar endoscopically using a snare device. About 2 h into the procedure, a repeat set of labs were drawn which showed significant improvement in his labs showing a WBC of now 7600/mcL (from 19,000/mcL), creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL (from 1.4 mg/dL), lactate of 0.86 mmol/L (from 3.94 mmol/L), and a troponin of 0.046 ng/mL (from 0.101 ng/mL). A discussion between the surgical team, anesthesia, and gastroenterology (via telephone) was done in the operating room for planning. Given his hemodynamic stability, improving lab values, and previous CT scan which showed no gross evidence of a leak, the decision was made to end the procedure for further resuscitation with plans to return to the OR for interval endoscopy to re-assess the esophagus. In the meantime, the patient was continued on broad spectrum antibiotics (to include antifungal coverage). He was kept Nil per os (NPO) and was admitted to the intensive care unit.
The patient remained hemodynamically normal and clinically stable throughout the night. The multi-disciplinary team determined the best course of action to be complete bezoar debridement, placement of NG tube, nutrition and medical optimization, workup for possible underlying esophageal pathology (to include completion EGD, manometry, and pH probe), and eventual endoscopic versus surgical management of determined condition. The above was again relayed to the patient and his family who fully supported the plan. The bezoar debridement was completed, and the esophagus was inspected for luminal integrity. An NG tube was able to be carefully placed under direct visualization.
The patient did well and was eventually able to be downgraded to the regular surgical floor. During his stay, a gastrostomy tube was obtained for feeding access and nutritional optimization. He would undergo several follow-up EGDs during his hospitalization to completely clear the bezoar and assess the esophageal lumen (Figs. and ). After discharge, the patient was further worked up and was found to have achalasia and esophagitis. Thorough workup includes a barium swallow study (patient’s barium swallow shown in Fig. ), EGD, manometry, pH study, and a chest CT (for, among other things, surgical planning). He was followed up in the outpatient setting for further management.","

CR_ENG_261,English,"A 19-year-old male patient presented with the complaints of an unsatisfactory facial appearance due to a prominent and asymmetric lower jaw. Clinical evaluation revealed facial asymmetry, a skeletal Class III and dental Class III malocclusion with a crossbite on the left side, a retrognathic maxilla, prognathic mandible, and a mandibular median line deviation of 13 mm to the left [Figure -]. Photographic analysis revealed a deep mentolabial sulcus and an increased width of the nose. The tip of the nose and the tip of the chin did not lie on the same straight line, and there was an obvious slewing and deviation of the chin to the left.
Dental crowding was observed in the upper and lower anterior region [Figure -]. The maxillary arch was narrow and constricted. Upper and lower incisors were in an edge-to-edge relationship. Molar relationships were Class 1 on the right side and Class 2 on the left side. There was a posterior crossbite bilaterally. There was a shift of the mandibular dental midline to the left by 13 mm. Ratio of the upper-to-middle to lower third of face which should normally be 1:1:1 was 25:26:30, the inference which could be drawn was that there was an increased height of the lower third of the face.
This showed the face to be brachycephalic.
The patient had a concave facial profile with anterior divergence of the face.
Orthopantomogram revealed impacted third molar teeth [Figure and ], which were then surgically removed.
Posteroanterior and lateral cephalograms were obtained [Figure and ], and cephalometric analyses were carried out [Figure - and Tables -].
Facial soft tissue (Arnett and Holdaway's) analysis [] revealed an orthognathic profile, prominent chin, retrusive lips, large nose, increased upper lip thickness, evident strain of upper lip evident, and procumbent lower lip with reduced lower sulcus depth.
The problem list drawn for this patient included:
Facial proportion and esthetics Facial asymmetry and deviation to the left side Obtuse nasolabial angle Deep mentolabial sulcus Toothy smile Prominent chin. Dental alignment and symmetry Proclined upper incisors and retroclined lower incisors Crowding in upper and lower incisor regions Lower dental midline shift to the left Posterior crossbite Class 3 relation on the right side. Edge to edge bite. Anteroposterior relationship Class III skeletal base with retrognathic maxilla and prognathic mandible Class III molar relationship on the right side. Vertical relationship Skeletal vertical growth pattern.
The goals of treatment were to align the maxillary and mandibular dental arches, to improve the maxillary and mandibular incisor inclinations, to obtain ideal overjet and overbite, to correct the deviation of the lower median line, to achieve a good functional occlusion, and finally to improve the skeletal and soft-tissue profile.
A surgery-first approach (SFA) was planned for the patient, involving Le Fort I maxillary advancement surgery, bilateral sagittal split osteotomy of the mandible with setback, thereafter to be followed by orthodontic treatment.
After a careful extraoral analysis, the treatment planning was carried out using the Dolphin Digital Systems that can generate visual treatment objective (VTO) by overlapping the presurgical cephalometric tracing with the postsurgery one on the basis of the programmed skeletal movements. First, a VTO was generated, with repositioned dental elements and even the skeletal bone bases.
For preparation of the occlusal wafer splints, the maxillary and mandibular models were articulated by means of face bow transfer [Figure -] and thereafter set up in a proper Class 1 molar relationship and with a positive overbite. The most challenging and time-consuming step is the prediction of the final occlusion based on the current position of teeth. The term “intended transitional malocclusion” (ITM) is used to describe the occlusion that is used to fabricate the surgical splint and surgeon's guide during surgery. At least, a three-point contact must be established between the upper and lower models when deciding ITM.
Maxillary advancement was carried out first [Figures and ], followed by mandibular setback with rotation [] to correct the mandibular dental midline shift to the left. Occlusal wafer splints fabricated separately before each of the two surgeries, assisted in correct positioning of the maxilla and mandible intraoperatively prior to rigid internal fixation of the osteotomized segments. The anteroposterior decompensation for moderately retroclined and crowded lower incisors this Class III case could be achieved by setting up the molars in a Class I relationship with an excessive incisor overjet, and then the lower incisors could be aligned postoperatively to obtain a normal overjet [].
The anteroposterior decompensation for the proclined maxillary incisors was accomplished after surgery, which resulted in further improvement in the facial profile.
The upper and lower dentitions were bonded and banded preoperatively, but no arch wires were placed. Orthodontic arch wires were placed 1-week postoperatively and orthodontic treatment for the dental alignment begun, while the osteotomized jaw bones were held steadily by the rigid fixation. During the 6-month treatment period, excellent esthetic results and good functional occlusion were achieved [Figures and ].","

CR_ENG_262,English,"A 73-year-old Japanese woman had been diagnosed as having RA 5 years before presentation and was initially treated with etanercept at 50 mg/week. Her family history included no consanguinity or collagen diseases. Two years before presentation, she had suffered tuberculous cervical lymphadenitis and had stopped taking etanercept because of remission. After 1 year, she was diagnosed as having interstitial pneumonia by chest computed tomography (CT) (Fig. a). Her RA disease activity gradually increased, and she was started on methotrexate (MTX) at 6 mg/week 18 months before presentation. She was referred to our hospital because of her increasing disease activity. Because control of the RA was incomplete, the dose of MTX was gradually increased to 10 mg/week. Two month before treatment of biologics, chest X-ray was performed and diagnosed as having interstitial pneumonia again (Fig. b). As the disease was refractory, biological therapy with etanercept at 25 mg/week was readministered when the RA was diagnosed as class 2, stage II. Five weeks later, she presented at our hospital complaining of cough and shortness of breath that had persisted for 2 weeks. On admission, the patient’s body temperature was 35.7 °C and her respiratory rate was 18 breaths/min. Chest auscultation revealed bilateral fine crackles. Arterial blood gas analysis on 2L of O2 via a nasal cannula showed a pH of 7.41, PaO2 89.3 Torr, PaCO2 38.1 Torr, and HCO3− 23.7 mmol/L. Laboratory examinations revealed a white blood cell count of 6930/μL (neutrophils: 97.0 %, lymphocytes: 3.0 %, monocytes: 0.0 %, eosinophils: 0.0 %, basophils: 0.0 %), lactate dehydrogenase 424 IU/L, C-reactive protein 20.7 mg/dL, procalcitonin 0.83 ng/mL, sialylated carbohydrate antigen Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6) 1035 U/mL, surfactant protein D (SP-D) 262.9 ng/mL, and β-d-glucan 158 U/mL. Although the CT findings did not suggest malignancy, the levels of tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9), and soluble interleukin-2 receptor (sIL-2R) were elevated at 8.5 ng/mL, 799 and 2954 U/mL, respectively. In addition, an HIV test had a negative result. A chest X-ray showed demonstrated GGOs in the middle and lower lung fields. High-resolution CT (HRCT) showed GGOs with thickened interlobular septa and traction bronchiectasis (Fig. ). We suspected that the patient had PCP, but MTX-induced lung disease and cytomegalovirus pneumonia were included in the differential diagnosis. We then stopped the MTX therapy and started the patient on trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (SMX/TMP) at a TMP dose of 720 mg daily with empirical meropenem antibiotic therapy. On the 2nd hospital day, chest CT was performed again and this showed that CT-attenuation of pulmonary infiltrates had increased and the beginning of architectural distortions was evident (Fig. a). Bronchoscopy was performed on the third hospital day. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) performed in the right middle lobe yielded 20 mL of fluid, but no significant pathogens were cultured from it. However, the results of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for P. jirovecii were positive, even though para-aminosalicylic acid and Grocott-Gomori methenamine silver nitrate staining of the BAL fluid revealed no P. jirovecii cysts. The patient was diagnosed as having PCP, and SMX/TMP was administered for 14 days. On the 14th hospital day, skin eruption was observed, and this was considered to be a drug reaction; therefore SMX/TMP was switched to pentamidine. On the 14th hospital day, the patient developed dyspnea and her coughing increased. In addition, the PaO2 on 3L of O2 per cannula decreased to 63.4 Torr. A chest X-ray and HRCT performed on the 8th hospital day showed an increase in GGO and parenchymal consolidations with progression of the architectural distortions and pleural effusion (Fig. b, c). These findings were considered to reflect an immune response due to the treatment for PCP with SMX/TMP alone. Therefore, we administered methylprednisolone from 2nd hospital day (500 mg/day intravenously for 3 days, followed by 250 mg/day intravenously for 3 days and 125 mg/day intravenously for 3 days). Shortness of breath was progressive and saturation of O2 was decreased, necessitating readministration of methylprednisolone from the 11th hospital day (1000 mg/day intravenously for 3 days and then 500 mg/day intravenously for 3 days). In addition, direct hemoperfusion using a polymyxin B-immobilized fiber column was performed on the 11th hospital day. A chest X-ray performed on the 15th hospital day showed an increase in GGO with pleural effusion (Fig. d). The patient’s respiratory condition worsened, and 500 mg of intravenous cyclophosphamide was added on the 18th hospital day. Repeated examination of chest X-ray was performed on the 18th and 21st day and revealed no improvement (Fig. e, f). However, The β-d-glucan level was not elevated at any time during the patient’s hospital course. It is known that the level of KL-6, a marker of interstitial lung disease, is increased in patients with PCP. The KL-6 level in our patient was 1441 U/mL on the 10th hospital day and 1585 U/mL on the 11th hospital day. However, the patient’s respiratory status deteriorated rapidly, and she died on the 25th day of hospitalization (Fig. ).","

CR_ENG_263,English,"A 46-year-old female patient with no smoking history sought treatment due to tussiculation. CT scan found a mass in the upper left hilum with bilateral mediastinal lymph nodes, liver, and bone metastases. Tumor biopsy (bronchoscopy) pathology revealed invasive lung adenocarcinoma in the upper left lobe. No positive mutation or rearrangement of EGFR or ALK was found on molecular testing of small biopsy specimens. PD-L1 expression of tumor tissue measured based on tumor proportion score was positive. The patient was diagnosed IV lung adenocarcinoma in October 2015. She was administered 18 cycles of pemetrexed plus cisplatin and bevacizumab and was subjected to thrombectomy for hepatic artery chemotherapy. In April 2017, a CT scan revealed that metastatic lesions in the liver increased significantly () and thus the patient was administered low-dose decitabine (10 mg/day, days 1–5) plus camrelizumab (200 mg, day 6) every 3 weeks for 8 cycles. After 2 cycles of treatment, abdominal magnetic resonance imaging revealed a reduction in the lesions of the liver lobe (). What's more, tussiculation of the patient also improved significantly. After 8 cycles of therapy, the patient showed enlarged liver lesions. She stopped combination therapy as a result of disease progression. Simultaneously, TMB decreased from 1.91 to 1.16 Muts/Mb, TNB decreased from 0.75 to 0.45 Neos/Mb, and MSI status and HLA LOH events remained unchanged. The patient complained of occasional mild decreased appetite. Physician assessed him to have controllable grade 2 hyperthyroidism and grade 2 fatigue based on the CTCAE (version 4.0) during combination therapy. After disease progression, she switched to crizotinib orally because ALK gene mutation was detected.

CR_ENG_265,English,"Patient 1, a 48 year old female, who had a history of progressive heart failure, dyspnoea at rest and cyanosis for three weeks prior to hospitalization. The patient had no complaints of fever above 38 C, night sweating or loss of more than 10 % of body weight over a period of six or less (B symptoms). On the day of hospitalization a transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) was performed. An inhomogeneous tumour was found in both atria. It was almost closing the orifice of the tricuspid valve (the diameter of the tricuspid valve orifice was 2.38 cm and the diameter of the part of the tumour closing the orifice was 2.25 cm) and penetrating the left ventricle via the interventricular septum. Complete blood count (CBC) and coagulation profile test (CPT) were within normal limits. The patient was immunocompetent and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tests were negative. Due to a rapid and severe heart failure an open chest operation was performed, during which a biopsy of the tumour was taken. Fast intra-operative analysis of the specimen revealed that the tumour was malignant. Because the tumour was inoperable and the patient’s hemodynamics was unstable, a decision was made to perform a Fontan procedure as a palliative method in order to stabilize the patient’s condition and to provide time for chemotherapy. The superior vena cava (SVC) was anastomosed to the right pulmonary artery (RPA) (Fig. ). This way venous blood flow was redirected to the lungs and obstructed right heart was bypassed. After the surgery, the patient’s condition improved. She was extubated on the second day after the surgery. Breathing was spontaneous and arterial blood oxygen saturation (SaO2) was 92 %. A detailed histological exam of the tumour revealed that it was diffuse large B cell lymphoma. There were no evidence of extra-cardiac lymphoma present, thus the final diagnosis was primary cardiac lymphoma. When the patient recovered from the surgery, she decided to continue her chemotherapy treatment at a foreign oncology clinic.

CR_ENG_268,English,A 5-year-old girl presented with progressive difficulty in walking and tightness of all limbs []. She had mild developmental delay in the form of delayed sitting and walking and she could never run or climb stairs. She had clumsiness and frequent falls while walking. She had seizures of simple partial motor type beginning with right lower limb jerking and followed by generalization since 8 months of age. The seizures responded well to treatment with carbamazepine. The child had moderate impairment of cognitive and language abilities and could not go to school. Her brother (case 3) had similar features but much milder clinical course. Megalencephaly was not noted till presentation. The head circumference was 56 cm which was above the 95th percentile for age. The mental examination was suggestive of severe language impairment. The motor system examination was suggestive of severe spasticity with grade 4 power of all limbs. She had exaggerated reflexes and bilateral planters were extensor. She had severe incoordination much more than could be attributed to the mild limb weakness. She had a scissoring gait and walked on her toes. Her MRI [] showed temporal polar subcortical cysts along with other characteristic features suggestive of the disease.,"

CR_ENG_269,English,"A 60-year-old male presented with cough and blood in sputum for three days. While he denied any fever, chills, chest pain, night sweats, and change in appetite or weight recently, review of system was significant for exertional shortness of breath and dizziness for the last few months. He also denied bleeding from any other site or bluish patches in the skin. His past medical history was significant for chronic hepatitis C, recurrent invasive thymoma, type 4 pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thromboembolism, and an episode of deep vein thrombosis. He was initially diagnosed with Masaoka stage II, World Health Organization type B1 thymoma, and underwent surgical resection for the same. There was, however, local recurrence of his disease three years later, and he was treated with chemotherapy and radiation. His only current home medications were sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for chronic hepatitis C. At presentation, his blood pressure was 104/69 mm of Hg, temperature was 98 F, pulse rate was 87 beats per minute, and oxygen saturation was 98% in room air. Physical examination was unremarkable except for marked conjunctival pallor. Initial lab work showed total white blood cell of 8,500/μL (normal 4,500–11,000/μL), total red blood cell of 1.88 million/μL (normal 4–5.7 million/μL), hemoglobin of 5.8 g/dL (normal 13–17 g/dL), mean corpuscular volume of 88.4 fL (normal 80–100 fL), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of 34.6 g/dL (normal 30.5–36 g/dL), and a platelet count of 16,000/μL (normal 130,000–400,000/μL), serum potassium of 4.7 mmol/L (normal 3.6–5.1 mmol/L), blood urea nitrogen of 15 mg/dL (normal 8–20 mg/dL), serum creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (normal 0.4–1.3 mg/dL), total serum bilirubin of 1.4 mg/dL (normal 0.3–1.2 mg/dL), aspartate aminotransferase of 25 IU/L (normal 15–41 IU/L), and alanine aminotransferase of 15 IU/L (normal 17–63 IU/L). Subsequent tests revealed a low reticulocyte of 0.09% (normal 0.5–2%) with a reticulocyte index of 0.02 and a lactate dehydrogenase of 168 IU/L (normal 98–192 IU/L). With the chest imaging showing stable postoperative changes in the upper left hemothorax with stable chronic pulmonary embolism, and the subsequent blood cultures, sputum cultures, and 3 sets of acid fast bacillus smears returning negative, the hemoptysis was attributed to severe thrombocytopenia, possibly due to hepatitis C-induced immune-complex mediated thrombocytopenia or myelodysplasia secondary to prior chemotherapy. The patient was transfused with 2 units of packed red cells, 1 unit of single donor platelets and started on intravenous methylprednisolone at a dose of 1,000 mg daily for three days followed by 125 mg daily. The patient had no further episode of hemoptysis or bleeding from any other site; however, his RBCs (2.46 million/μL), Hb (7.2 g/dL), Hct (21.5%), and platelets (26,000/μL) continued to be severely low even after two weeks of steroid therapy. A bone marrow biopsy was done which revealed hypercellular marrow with severely depleted megakaryocytes and erythroid precursor cells and relative myeloid hyperplasia without features of neoplasm (). This suggested amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and red cell aplasia, and the patient was started on oral cyclosporine at a daily dose of 6 mg/kg body weight. However, fourth day into therapy and he started to develop leukopenia with a WBC of 1,300/μL and an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of 700/μL (normal 2,000–7,900/μL) while his Hb (6.4 g/dL), Hct (18.4%), and platelet count (17,000/μL) continued to be very low. The daily dose of oral cyclosporine was subsequently reduced to 3 mg/kg body weight, and he was started on subcutaneous filgrastim at a dose of 480 μg daily. However, after nine days of cyclosporine therapy along with multiple platelet and red cell transfusions, the patient refused any further treatment or diagnostic procedures and left the hospital against medical advice. His last hematological parameters before discharge included a WBC of 3,900/μL with an ANC of 1,400/μL, Hb of 7.3 g/dL, Hct of 21.4%, and platelet count of 43,000/μL.","

CR_ENG_270,English,"A 52 year old male smoker undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting for three vessel coronary artery disease and moderately impaired left ventricular function was felt to have a mass arising from the under surface of right costal margin adjacent to right lower sternal margin while sternopericardial ligament was being broken off by finger dissection prior to sternotomy. Preoperative chest X-ray suggested a soft, globular paracardiac shadow in relation to the right pericardiophrenic angle, appreciated better retrospectively (Figure ) Sternotomy was made, the right pleura was opened to facilitate delineation of the mass. The mass measured 8 × 6 × 3 cms and was arising from the right costal margin and the adjacent surfaces of 7th, 8th, 9th and 10th ribs (Figure ). The mass was of firm to hard and variable consistency and was filled with cartilaginous material and there was no definite demarcation between the mass and the chest wall. The chest wall mass was excised in its entirety along with the intercostal muscle and the periosteum (Figure , Figure and Figure ). The frozen section revealed it to be either a chondrosarcoma or teratoma. Quadruple coronary artery bypass grafting to left anterior descending artery and its diagonal branch, obtuse marginal branch of circumflex artery and left ventricular branch of right coronary artery was performed using left internal mammary artery and long saphenous vein for conduits, employing cardiopulmonary bypass with antegrade cold blood cardioplegic arrest. Patient made uncomplicated postoperative recovery.
Histopathology revealed the overall appearances of grade 1 chondrosarcoma with a tumour composed of lobules of cartilage of varying size separated by fibrous tissue (Figure ). The chondrocytes showed cytological atypia, binucleate cells, focal hypercellular areas with areas of calcification and necrosis (Figure ). The tumour was seen to focally infiltrate into surrounding skeletal muscle.
The patient was discussed at the Regional Sarcoma MDT. Further excisional surgery in view of the positive surgical margins was not felt to reduce the risk of local recurrence in view of the possibility of microscopic seeding at surgery. There was also no role of adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy in view of the known resistance of grade 1 chondrosarcoma.
Patient was discharged home on 7th postoperative day. He has been followed at 3 monthly intervals with routine radiography including CT scans. He has made good recovery from the operation, is in NYHA class 1 and has shown no clinical or radiological signs of local recurrence, more than a year after his surgery.","

CR_ENG_271,English,"A 69-year-old male with a body mass index of 21.5 kg/m2 was referred to our hospital due to jaundice for a suspected cholangiocarcinoma.
His past medical and surgical history was unremarkable, except for diabetes type 2 and hypertension; both conditions were controlled with medications, including metformin 500 mg twice a day, glimepiride 1 mg twice a day, nifedipine CR 20 mg daily, valsartan 80 mg daily and enalapril 5 mg daily.
His social history was significant for smoking 20 cigarettes per day for 46 years and the frequent intake of alcohol at approximately 360-540 mL a day.
Family history was notable for a father diagnosed with esophageal cancer, a mother with uterine cancer and an elderly brother with duodenal cancer and leukemia.
On examination, the patient had icteric sclera and pale conjunctiva. His vital signs were stable, and physical examination did not reveal any extraordinary signs.
Laboratory tests on admission were within the normal range, except for a mild elevation in the levels of alkaline phosphatase (507 IU/L; normal range, < 359 IU/L), γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (199 IU/L; normal range, < 47 IU/L) and total serum bilirubin (1.4 mg/dL normal range, < 1 mg/dL). Carcinoembryonic antigen and CA 19-9 were within the normal range (2.7 ng/mL, 13.6 U/mL, respectively). Serology was negative for hepatitis B and C infections.
Endoscopic ultrasonography detected a solid lesion filling the intrapancreatic CBD to the main biliary. There was no evidence of extension outside of the bile duct wall, and invasion into the right hepatic artery was not observed. In addition, multilocular and unilateral cystic lesions of the pancreas, which had a maximum diameter of 13.1 mm, were found. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiography revealed bilateral intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation with a ﬁlling defect in the upper and middle bile duct, which extended partly to the left hepatic duct. Intraductal ultrasonography confirmed that there was no extended lesion in the right bile duct. Tumor and adjacent tissue biopsies were performed, and a 5 Fr endoscopic nasobiliary drainage ENBD was placed to facilitate biliary drainage. Pathological results endorsed IPNB with high grade and intestinal type neoplasia. In addition, images obtained from peroral cholangioscopy POCS delineated a tumor with a papillary pattern located at the CBD to the left hepatic duct (Figure ). Multidetector computed tomography detected an interruption for a long segment of CBD causing biliary occlusion, which resulted in bilateral intrahepatic biliary tree dilatation with no intrahepatic lesion. The tumor was predominantly extended into the left hepatic duct. An enlargement of the pancreatic duct suggested the extension of injury into the intrapancreatic CBD. Traces of metastasis, such as lymph node growth, ascites, lung mass or pleural effusion, have not been reported. Three-dimensional liver surgery simulation demonstrated that the right hepatic artery and right portal vein were not in contact with the tumor. Mmagnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography confirmed these findings (Figure ).
Therefore, an initial diagnosis of IPNB cT1N0M0 was established with good prognosis.","

CR_ENG_272,English,"A 10-year old 28.7 kg male neutered mixed-breed dog presented for a follow-up visit after having been hospitalized for 24 h the previous week with severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and hypovolemic shock. Prior to this episode the dog had been on 0.35 mg/kg oral prednisolone daily for months due to dermatological problems (described by the client as pruritus). This treatment had been stopped at the initial presentation with gastroenteritis. The dog’s coagulation status (PT, aPTT, TEG) had been unremarkable during hospitalization apart from a moderate thrombocytopenia (65 × 109/L) which had not been confirmed microscopically. On presentation at the control visit the dog was bright, alert, and responsive, was eating and drinking normally, and the owner considered it to have recovered except for still having slightly soft stools. The dog was still receiving treatment with antibiotics and gastroprotectives.
The clinical exam was unremarkable. A hematological profile was analyzed, revealing a platelet count of 46 × 109/L, a mild non-regenerative anemia (hematocrit 0.37) and mild eosinophilia (1.59 × 109/L). Biochemistry was unremarkable. CRP was below 25 mg/L. A coagulation profile and a TEG were requested in order to further evaluate the patient’s hemostatic state and possible need for transfusion therapy, revealing an aPTT of 18 s, unmeasurable PT and fibrinogen, and a d-dimer of 3.7 mg/L. The TEG (Fig. c, Table ) showed severe hypocoagulability (prolonged R, decreased α and MA; K was not reached). A FFP-TEG with the in vitro addition of 50 µL FFP was performed, leading to improvement of all parameters, but without complete normalization of the coagulation status. An additional FFP-TEG with 100 µL FFP (corresponding to 20 mL/kg FFP) did not result in further improvement. A von Willebrand factor analysis was also performed with a result of 68%. This assay was calibrated on a plasma pool from healthy dogs and the sample result extrapolated from the standard curve and reported as percentage with > 70% considered the normal range and < 50% considered abnormal.
It was considered most likely that the dog had developed disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) secondary to the severe systemic inflammatory reaction it had suffered the previous week. A secondary immune-mediated thrombocytopenia could not be ruled out. To rule out other underlying causes the dog was tested for tick-borne agents (serology for Borrelia sp., Anaplasma sp., and Erhlichia sp. measured with IDEXX 4dx) and gastrointestinal parasites (Giardia sp. and Cryptosporidium sp.), all of which were negative. A Baermann fecal analysis was performed, in which one larva, considered to be a Crenosoma vulpis larva, was found, but A. vasorum could not be completely ruled out due to the quality of the larva (an antigen test was not commercially available at this time). The dog had no history of exercise intolerance or coughing, and thoracic radiographs were unremarkable. As the dog had a history of skin problems which had previously responded to prednisolone, an antinuclear antibody test was also performed and was negative.
While the suspected DIC was subclinical at this stage, the hypocoagulability detected by TEG was considered of importance because it is a known negative prognostic factor for dogs with DIC []. Hence, as benefit of FFP transfusion was revealed by the FFP-TEG, this treatment was considered indicated. A transfusion of 10 mL/kg of FFP was administered, according to the amount predicted as optimal by the FFP-TEG. The dog was also started on fenbendazole in order to treat possible angiostrongylosis. A subsequent TEG revealed a tracing corresponding to the one predicted by the FFP-TEG. The dog remained clinically stable and was discharged. Final follow-up visits revealed normalization of all parameters of hemostasis.","

CR_ENG_273,English,"A 69-year-old man who suffered from pain and swelling in the bilateral groin and from frequent voiding visited our clinic. He had undergone bilateral transabdominal preperitoneal repair (B-TAPP) three years earlier at another hospital. During his physical examination, bilateral inguinal swelling was observed before urination, and he complained about micturition when we tried to reintroduce the hernia contents. A CT scan revealed that his urinary bladder was herniating into the bilateral inguinal hernias with a typical “Mickey Mouse” shape (Figures and ). From these findings, we diagnosed a recurrent bilateral bladder hernia after B-TAPP. Then, we preoperatively planned to employ the bladder takedown approach to pull the urinary bladder from the orifice and to perform median TAPP.
With the patient in the supine position under general anesthesia, we inserted three trocars as shown in . Trocar placements were on the cranial side of the umbilicus compared to usual TAPP. At first, we confirmed that the lateral side of the mesh was appropriately covered by the prior mesh and that there were no recurrent indirect hernias. Then, we incised the peritoneum on the ventral side of the urinary bladder and took down the bladder to expose the hernia orifices (). Both hernia orifices were located inside of both medial umbilical folds; therefore, we intraoperatively diagnosed a recurrent bilateral supravesical bladder hernia with no lateral recurrences (). We introduced a laparoscopic self-fixating mesh (ProGrip™, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) into the peritoneal cavity and unrolled the mesh as both hernia orifices were covered. The mesh was fixed with Cooper's ligament and the rectus sheath by a mesh fixation device (AbsorbaTack™, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) to keep it from slipping (). Finally, we sutured the urinary bladder with the ventral peritoneum to close the preperitoneal space and to screen the mesh using a barbed suture device (V-Loc™ 180, Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) (). The operative time was 132 minutes, and the total blood loss was 2 mL. We included only median mesh repair for bilateral recurrent inguinal hernias as the name of the median TAPP procedure.
The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3 without any complications, and his preoperative symptoms disappeared. A postoperative CT showed no recurrence of the bilateral supravesical bladder hernias ().","

CR_ENG_274,English,"The patient is 29 years old with gravida 3, parity 2, and abortion 1. Her first pregnancy was completed in 2012 at term with cesarean section, and the second one was ended in 2017 at term with a cesarean section again. There was a history of revision curettage due to incomplete abortion in December 2018. The patient did not receive the pathology results after curettage and did not go to the postprocedure control examination. In May 2020, probe curettage was performed at another center because of the continuation of irregular vaginal bleeding. The patient was referred to our clinic after the diagnosis as a choriocarcinoma.
During the gynecological examination of the patient, the perineum, vulva, and vagina were normal, there was minimal bleeding from cervix, the corpus uteri was normal in size, and the adnexa were normal. Transvaginal ultrasonography (TVS) revealed a 26x25 mm, irregular, solid lesion on the caesarian scar line, and it is extending to the uterine serosa (Figure a, b). There was no sign in favor of gestational sac or molar pregnancy in the uterine cavity. Bilateral tuba and ovaries were normal. Patient's B-HCG value was 15.600 mIU/ml. Abdominal and thorax CT, brain MRI, and pelvic MRI were performed for extrauterine spread. Liver and thyroid function tests were normal. Brain MRI and thorax CT findings were normal; pelvic MRI showed solid mass penetrating the serosa with a size of 3.5 × 2.9 cm in cesarean scar localization at uterus isthmus. The patient's pathology specimens were re-examined by a gynecologic pathologist to confirm the diagnosis. B-HCG in tumor cells immunohistochemically was positive, and high proliferation was observed with Ki-67 (Figure A,B). Stage 1 and WHO score: 6 (1 point; occurrence after abortion, 2 points; index diagnosis at 7th month after pregnancy, 2 points; b-HCG; being 15600, 1 point; tumor diameter measuring between 3-4 cm) Single agent chemotherapy treatment was planned for the patient in the gynecological oncology council. After three-cycle treatments of MTX + folinic acid and EMA-CO [etoposide, methotrexate, actinomycin D cyclophosphate, and vincristine (Oncovin)], chemotherapy was started due to the plateau of B-HCG. After 8 cycles of EMA-CO chemotherapy, B-HCG value is < 1 mIU/ml. At the same time, pelvic MRI showed that the mass on the cesarean scar line was completely regressed (Figure ). Two months later after the end of chemotherapy, B-HCG was found to be 77 mIU/mL and the patient suffered from vaginal bleeding. Ultrasound showed an irregular, solid mass with a diameter of 32 × 25 mm in the cesarean scar line, and a recurrence was considered. Pelvic MRI reported a 30 × 27 × 28 mm mass lesion located in the anterior part of the uterine isthmus (on the caesarian scar line), which restricting diffusion, showing heterogeneous contrast enhancement and containing necrotic areas (Figure A,B). Subsequent weekly B-HCG values were 204 and 586 mIU/mL, respectively. Partial uterine resection or hysterectomy options were discussed with the patient due to future child request. The patient preferred laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy. In intraoperative exploration, it was observed that the cervico-isthmic part was barrel-shaped and extended toward parametrium bilaterally. The uterine serosa was thin in the isthmus. It was noticed that there was an increased vascularization above the bladder peritoneum. Peritoneal washing samples were taken. The retroperitoneal approach was decided due to technically difficult coagulation of the uterine artery because of the barrel-shaped cervix and the presence of a bleeding-prone tumor. By entering the retroperitoneal area from either side of the uterus, the ureters were visualized. Where uterine arteries originated from the hypogastric artery, they were coagulated with 5 mm ligasure. Total laparoscopic hysterectomy and bilateral salpingectomy were performed (Figure ). Due to possible tumoral invasion, the hypervascularized bladder peritoneum was resected. Estimated blood loss was 10-20 cc. The patient was discharged uncomplicated on the postoperative second day. The final pathology result was reported as choriocarcinoma. The B-HCG value was 6.3 mIU/ml in the first-week control of postoperative and < 1 mIU/ml in the next week. The patient who received weekly series of B-HCG follow-up was given two more cycles of EMA-CO chemotherapy. The patient is well, without recurrence after three months.","

CR_ENG_276,English,"A 24-year-old male with metastatic papillary thyroid cancer underwent total thyroidectomy with bilateral neck dissections. The left recurrent laryngeal nerve was sacrificed due to tumor involvement. Following the procedure, the patient had to be re-intubated in the operating room due to stridor and respiratory distress. He was extubated on post-operative day (POD) 1. The otolaryngology service was consulted to evaluate the vocal folds due to known recurrent laryngeal nerve sacrifice. The patient underwent vocal fold injection augmentation on POD 5 and was discharged home on POD 7. At the time of vocal cord injection, granulation tissue was incidentally noted along the anterior tracheal wall, extending inferiorly approximately 5 mm. This was suspected to be secondary to recent intubation. Biopsy of the granulation tissue was obtained, and histopathology was later reported as consistent with ""fibrulopurulent exudate and few reactive squamous epithelial cells"".
The patient returned to the clinic for his scheduled follow-up on POD 12. He reported to his surgeon that, for the previous one to two days, his neck would swell with cough or valsalva. CT of the neck demonstrated ventral cervical and mid tracheal defects with extensive mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema (Figures -). The otolaryngology service was again consulted, and the patient was taken urgently to the operating room. Intraoperatively, the following two distinct areas of tracheal injury were identified: (a) a 1-cm defect of the anterior wall at rings 2 and 3 and (b) a second defect involving perforation of the anterior intercartilaginous membranes from rings 9 to 12 (Figure ).
A combined approach by the otolaryngology and cardiothoracic services was required to fully expose the defect. The superior defect was repaired with sternocleidomastoid flap and the inferior defect with a pectoralis flap. Due to evolution of the tracheal injury, the inferior repair had to be revised approximately two weeks later. Additional necrotic trachea was debrided. The defect was closed with a thick acellular dermal matrix allograft over a silicone stent. This was reinforced with an omental flap. The stent was removed after one week, and a tracheotomy was placed through the previously repaired proximal defect. A 7.0-mm diameter adjustable length tracheostomy tube was used to span the reconstructed trachea, functioning as both airway and stent. Three weeks post-operatively, bronchoscopy showed a patent airway with signs of epithelialization (Figures ,3B). Serial bronchoscopies at 6 and 12 months post-operatively revealed that the trachea was healed, with no malacia on deep respiration (Figures -).","

He had visited another hospital 1 month earlier because of pain on the left side of his chest. At this hospital, he underwent chest radiography and computed tomography (CT), which showed a left pleural effusion. Diagnostic thoracentesis was performed, yielding 200 mL of clear, yellow-colored pleural fluid. Analysis of the pleural fluid revealed an exudative pattern; a protein level of 5.3 g/dL (serum protein level, 7.5 g/dL), a lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level of 273 IU/L (serum LDH level, 342 IU/L), a glucose level of 61 mg/dL, an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL, and a pH of 7.3. The pleural fluid cell count was 2,560 cells/mL, with 10% polymorphonuclear cells, 90% lymphocytes, and an adenosine deaminase (ADA) concentration of 82 IU/L. No malignant cells were observed on cytological analysis. Bacterial, fungal, and mycobacterial cultures of the pleural fluid were also negative. The patient was diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy and was administered anti-tuberculosis medications. After treatment, the pleural effusion and chest pain disappeared and the patient was discharged from the hospital. However, 2 weeks later, he developed new symptoms of fever, chills, and night sweating, which caused worry because of the patient's past illness. Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type. He had been successfully treated with treatment with a combined of chemotherapy and radiotherapy resulting in a complete remission without recurrence. Upon admission, the patient's vital signs were stable, except for the presence of fever. In addition, laboratory findings were within the normal range. A chest radiograph showed findings consistent with a small amount of pleural effusion (). A chest CT scan revealed an heterogeneously enhanced-mass to the left of the eight thoracic spines (). A subsequent 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (18F-FDG)-positron emission tomography revealed FDG activity at the same site (). A biopsy using video-assisted thoracic surgery was performed. Subsequent analysis by microscopy showed that the pleural tissue was diffusely infiltrated with atypical lymphoid cells (). It was CD3 +, CD56 +, granzyme B +, and EBV + (). These histological features were corresponded with the previous biopsy from nasal cavity eight years ago (). This led us to diagnose the patient's condition as recurrent pleural recurrence of extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma.

CR_ENG_280,English,"A 66-year-old woman of Hui nationality living in Hualong County, Qinghai Province presented with a 20-day history of upper abdominal distension and discomfort with no obvious cause. The patient’s spirit, diet, sleep, and weight had not changed substantially. Fallopian tube ligation had been performed 30 years previously, and she had a history of chronic atrophic gastritis. No abdominal tenderness or hepatosplenic mass was found.
After admission, abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography showed cystic lesions with thick-walled annular calcification slightly protruding from the superior spleen to the spleen–stomach space (). Primary splenic hydatidosis was considered. Pulmonary scans showed chronic bronchitis. No obvious abnormalities were found in the craniocerebral or pelvic scans.
The biochemical examination results () showed negativity for anti-Echinococcus IgG antibody. The total, direct, and indirect bilirubin concentrations were increased, indicating occult jaundice. The alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, sodium, and potassium concentrations were within the reference ranges. The patient had no antibodies to hepatitis B, syphilis, or human immunodeficiency virus. Her blood type was O, Rh+. She had no significant abnormalities in her blood cell count and no history of vaccination before the operation.
Considering that the patient had no special contraindications for an operation, laparoscopic splenectomy was performed on the eighth day after admission. First, pneumoperitoneum was established using four puncture locations: the navel, 2 cm below the xiphoid process, the midline of the left clavicle, and the intersection point of the anterior axillary line and the left inferior border of the rib. We observed mild adhesions of the spleen with the omentum and diaphragm. Next, the perisplenic ligament was dissected and the upper edge of the pancreas was dissociated. The splenic artery was then separated and ligated. We used an ultrasonic knife to cut the perigastric vessels and then carefully separated the pancreatic tail around the splenic hilum. An Endo GIA stapler (Medtronic, Dublin, Ireland) was used to disconnect the splenic pedicle while protecting the tail of the pancreas from damage. Finally, we removed the spleen through an incision extending from the midline of the left clavicle to the anterior axillary line. The intraoperative blood loss volume was about 50 mL, and no transfusion was needed.
We encountered some difficulties during the operation. Moving the spleen was difficult because of the large lesion. The tail of the pancreas was close to the splenic hilum, making performance of the operation inconvenient. We also had to consider avoiding compression during removal of the spleen.
After the surgery, we found that the spleen measured about 10 × 8 × 4 cm and was hard and rounded. The cyst was located at the superior aspect of the spleen, and its dimensions were about 6 × 5 cm. Pathological examination showed calcification of fibrocystic walls and infiltration of chronic inflammatory cells (). A diagnosis of hydatidosis was confirmed.
After 14 days of medical therapy and careful nursing, the patient recovered well. Although her total bilirubin and direct bilirubin concentrations were slightly higher than before treatment, all other laboratory parameters were within the reference ranges. She was treated with albendazole at 15 mg/kg per day (divided into two daily doses) for 6 months after discharge from the hospital.
After 32 months of follow-up, the patient still showed no evidence of lesion recurrence. However, gastrointestinal bleeding as confirmed by gastroscopy occurred 3 months postoperatively. The specific cause was unknown, but the patient was uneventfully treated.","

CR_ENG_281,English,"An 18-year-old girl hailing from Kozhikode, South India, with no past history of any illness, visited our hospital with complaints of fever of 1 week duration. She also had headache that was increasing in intensity and aggravated in the early morning. She also had two episodes of vomiting. She complained of double vision on the third day of admission, which was followed by asymmetric weakness of both proximal distal muscles of all four limbs. There was no history of sensory disturbances and bladder or bowel dysfunction. On examination, her vitals were stable. There was no pallor, icterus, clubbing, lymphadenopathy, rashes or eschar on general examination. Neurological examination on admission revealed normal speech, intelligence and memory. There was no papilledema. She developed bilateral lateral rectus palsy (), with normal upgaze and papillary reflexes. Other cranial nerves were within normal limits. Motor system examination showed normal muscle bulk. Muscle groups in all limbs showed hypotonia with grade 3/5 power in the right lower limb, grade 2/5 power in the left lower limb and grade 4/5 power in both upper limbs. All deep tendon reflexes were sluggish. Sensory system examination was normal. There was neck stiffness with other signs of meningeal irritation. Rest of the systems were within normal limits. Her clinical course is summarized in .
Initial investigations revealed normal hemogram, with an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) of 95 mm in the first hour. Blood sugar, serum electrolytes and renal and liver function tests were within normal limits. Computerized tomography of brain was within normal limits.
With a history of fever and headache and findings of meningitis, lumbar puncture was done, which showed an opening pressure of 190 mm of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). CSF analysis revealed a CSF total count of 30 cells with 80% lymphocytes. CSF sugar was normal, and protein was mildly elevated (60 mg/dL [normal 20–40 mg/dL]). Bacterial cultures were sterile. CSF adenosine deaminase and culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. India ink stain for cryptococci was negative. Cytology did not show any malignant cells. CSF viral serology turned out to be positive for JE virus with positive IgM antibodies specific for the same insignificant titer. Autoimmune markers in CSF (NMDAR, LGI1, Caspr2, AMPAR [GluR1 and GluR2 subunits] and GABA-B-R) were negative.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain showed hyperintensities in bilateral thalami and in the limbic region, suggestive of limbic encephalitis (). MRI of the spine showed T2-weighted hyperintense signal intensities in the spinal cord caudally till the L1 level, predominantly involving the anterior horn cells, and rostrally, they extended upto pons, suggestive of longitudinal myelitis (). Electroencephalogram displayed slowing of delta waves in the frontotemporal region.
The patient was treated with supportive measures. However, she deteriorated with the development of altered sensorium and intermittent hypothermia. Oral, axillary, rectal temperature revealed a temperature <94°F on multiple occasions. Electrocardiogram at the time of hypothermia showed bradycardia, prolonged QT interval and Osborn wave (). Other causes of hypothermia such as hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism were ruled out with normal thyroid function tests and fasting serum cortisol levels. Warm saline infusions and intermittent rewarming were given at the time of hypothermia. She developed intractable seizures and autonomic instability and succumbed to her illness after 2 weeks of hospital care.

CR_ENG_282,English,"A 37-year-old man was admitted for the surgical treatment of a mediastinal tumor that was detected on a chest roentgenogram. CT showed that his mediastinal tumor was in the left thoracic outlet and adjacent to the left common carotid and left subclavian arteries (Fig. ). A definitive preoperative diagnosis was unavailable. The operation was started with VATS, in preparation for TMA. The patient was placed in the right semi-lateral decubitus position. Three access ports were placed at the 5th intercostal space on the anterior axillary line, the 3rd intercostal space on the midclavicular line, and the 3rd intercostal space on the anterior axillary line. Dissection of the caudal side was performed with VATS; however, the cranial side was judged to be difficult and risky to dissect owing to tumor location, poor visualization and difficulty in handling surgical devices. Therefore, TMA was sequentially performed, and the tumor was completely and safely resected. The intraoperative diagnosis was schwannoma. The patient was discharged 1 week after the operation. The final diagnosis was also schwannoma, and the tumor was completely resected. Horner syndrome appeared transiently, but he was well without Horner syndrome 1 year postoperatively.

CR_ENG_283,English,"A 50-year-old woman presented to our Breast Unit complaining of a gradually enlarging palpable mass in the middle outer portion of her left breast, that she first noticed 3 months ago. She had then undergone an ultrasonography at another institution which showed a mass measuring 1.1 × 1 cm with imaging features suggestive of a fibroadenoma. Her past medical history was significant for rheumatoid arthritis and asthma, whereas she had undergone an appendectomy and cesarean section twice at 25 and 28 years of age. She had no family history of breast or ovarian cancer whereas she had gone through the menopause at the age of 45 without taking any hormone replacement therapy.
On physical examination, a non-tender, mobile well-circumscribed mass measuring approximately 2.5 cm × 2 cm was palpated at the middle outer portion of the left breast. There were no skin alterations or nipple discharge whereas there were no palpable axillary or supraclavicular lymph nodes. Mammogram showed a multilobulated well-circumscribed mass without any calcifications () whereas a breast ultrasound showed an oval hypoechoic mass measuring 2.2 × 2 cm with mild degree of posterior acoustic enhancement (Fig.2). The aforementioned imaging characteristics were suggestive of a fibroadenoma.
Since the mass had over doubled in size over the previous 3 months, a wide local excision was performed. At surgery a well-circumscribed oval demarcated mass measuring 2.5 cm was easily resected along with a small cuff of surrounding tissues. Macroscopically, the tumor measuring 2.2 × 2.1 × 2 cm presented as a solid white elastic nodule with a smooth surface resembling a fibroadenoma. Histological examination of the mass revealed tubular breast adenoma. Closely approximated round and oval glandular structures composed of a single layer of epithelium and supported by a layer of myoepithelial cells were noticed. Little presence of stroma with mild fibrosis and myxoid degeneration was apparent whereas a small amount of secretion was present in the glandular lumens ().

CR_ENG_284,English,"A 40-year-old woman came to our attention for assistance in legal proceedings involving compensation for her compromised health condition. Her clinical history was significant for migraine, celiac disease, cephalosporin intolerance and nickel allergy. In 1996, she underwent Le Fort I osteotomy and bilateral positioning of two metal “L” plates and wires for maxillofacial malformation and malocclusion. There were no complications during surgery and follow-up. During the following years, the patient reported a significant increase in the pre-existing migraine with aura, photophobia and dizziness.
In 2004, the patient noticed the appearance of a skin rash located in the right regions of the forehead, nose, upper and lower jaw associated with trigeminal paresthesia. Ulcerations were painless but pruriginous. The right side of the face was severely disfigured; the left side had similar, but less severe, lesions. The tip of the nose was completely spared.
Dermatological examination diagnosed an allergy to nickel, a material found in the metal plates positioned during surgery 8 years before (); plates and wires were therefore removed in 2005. Instrumental tests, including skin biopsy, were negative for human herpes virus, autoimmune vascular and connective diseases, leprosy, granulomatosis and skin cancer. No clinically evident neurologic deficits were reported during neurological examination. In 2008, a psychiatrist also diagnosed a severe reactive chronic depressive syndrome caused by the social difficulties following the disfiguring effects of the disease. In 2010, the ulceration of the right ala nasi caused the collapse of the nasal septum ( and ).

CR_ENG_285,English,"A 22-year-old female college student began experiencing tender fingertips, one or two at a time, in August. She had an episode in early October of sudden onset numbness followed by pain in her proximal right forearm, associated with tenderness on deep palpation. Throughout October, she had episodes of soreness in rotating sites including the back of her head, her abdomen, her right thigh and right calf. Pain in her dorsal left foot awoke her in the middle of the night in late October. She woke up with a painful swollen right wrist (“felt like it was broken”), making it difficult to write, in early November.
The patient presented on November sixth to a nurse practitioner in a public health clinic with a chief complaint of intermittent muscle pain. She denied fever, chills, fatigue, bleeding or skin rash. Her temperature was 36.9 °C (98.5 °F), pulse 104 beats/minute, blood pressure 112/76 mmHg, and respirations 18 breaths/minute. She had normal heart sounds with no murmur heard, and normal peripheral pulses, musculoskeletal and neurological examination. Her white blood cell count was 7,800/cu mm (79% neutrophils) and hemoglobin 12.6 g/dL; platelets, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), albumin and total protein were all normal. She was diagnosed with “sensory disturbance (primary)” and given no treatment.
Over the next two months, the patient continued to have episodes of pain and tenderness for which she took over the counter ibuprofen and acetaminophen. She had an episode of “skin blotching” on the pad of a finger that she photographed⁠-one of the fingertips where she had been having transient tenderness before taking over the counter analgesic medications (Figure ). She denied fever, chills or fatigue. She was seen again on January third and was noted to be tearful and “worried about everything”. Her temperature was 36.5 °C (97.7 °F), pulse 112 beats/minute, blood pressure 128/80 mmHg, and respirations 18 breaths/minute. She had no murmur heard, and unchanged physical examination. She was diagnosed with a generalized anxiety disorder for which duloxetine was prescribed, and myalgia for which over the counter ibuprofen and acetaminophen were recommended.
The patient continued to have episodes of pain and tenderness for which she took ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but she discontinued taking duloxetine. She was seen in a hospital emergency department on January 18 with a chief complaint of “hurting all over with pain in fingers, toes, inflammation, swelling” and fingers going numb for six months. Her temperature was 36.6 °C (97.8 °F), pulse 111 beats/minute, and blood pressure 119/73 mmHg. Her white blood cell count was 9,580/cu mm (76% neutrophils), hemoglobin 10.9 g/dL and C-reactive protein 9.36 mg/dL (reference range, 0.02-0.50). She was discharged from the emergency department with a diagnosis of “multiple musculoskeletal pains-swelling” for which methocarbamol was prescribed.
The patient had an episode of paresthesia (tingling) on her upper back, an episode of left facial numbness and an episode of vertigo. She had an episode of skin blotching on her soles, which were tender, on January 30, that she photographed (Figure ).
The patient was seen in the emergency department on February 13 with sudden onset left flank pain, temperature 36.5 °C (97.7 °F), pulse 120 beats/minute, blood pressure 114/97 mm Hg and respirations 18 breaths/minute. She had normal heart sounds with no murmur heard, but tenderness over the left kidney. Her white blood cell count was 15,250/cu mm (85% neutrophils), hemoglobin 9.9 g/dL and albumin 3.2 g/dL; platelets, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, calcium, glucose, bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, ALT, AST, lipase and total protein were all normal. Urinalysis showed 15 white blood cells/high power field, 27 red blood cells/high power field and occasional bacteria. Abdominal computed tomography showed no abnormalities. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed and treated with morphine, acetaminophen-oxycodone, and ceftriaxone. Urine culture was ordered, but not obtained before the patient was discharged with prescriptions for tramadol, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin.
The patient presented on February 20 to the nurse practitioner in the public health clinic with episodes of moderate dizziness, a sensation of the room spinning with moving her head, lasting for minutes, associated with nausea, intermittently over the previous two weeks. The worst episode occurred that day and prompted her visit to the clinic. The patient denied headache, fever, chills, ear pain, teeth pain, sore throat or anxiety. Her temperature was 36.8 °C (98.2 °F), pulse 86 beats/minute, blood pressure 118/84 mm Hg and respirations 18 breaths/minute. While listening to the patient’s heart, the nurse asked her if she had ever had a heart murmur. The patient was unaware that she had and replied no. The nurse recorded hearing no murmur. Vertigo was diagnosed and the patient was prescribed meclizine.
The patient was admitted to a community hospital in another city on March fourth with sudden onset epigastric pain, associated with nausea, vomiting, and weight loss (3.6 kg). She had been lightheaded for several days and had had hematochezia for three days, three weeks prior. Her temperature was 36.6 °C (97.9 °F), pulse 104 beats/minute, blood pressure 116/79 mmHg, respirations 18 breaths/minute and oxygen saturation 96% on room air. She had epigastric tenderness and stool positive for occult blood. “No murmur heard” was reported by the admitting physician and no murmur was reported by any of the multiple other physicians on the case. The patient’s hemoglobin was 8.7 g/dL, mean corpuscular volume 83 fL, platelets 405,000/cu mm, and white blood cell count 11,600/cu mm (82% neutrophils). She had been taking ibuprofen, 1600 mg/day. Erosive gastritis was diagnosed by endoscopy and her anemia was attributed to acute blood loss from ibuprofen. She was discharged March fifth on pantoprazole, sucralfate, iron, and tramadol. Gastric biopsy was subsequently seen to show no abnormalities.
The following evening on March sixth, the patient suffered the sudden onset of the worst headache of her life with vomiting, then right leg weakness, “hip numbness”, difficulty walking (“her right leg gave out”), and brief loss of consciousness after she was helped to a couch. She was taken to the community hospital emergency department by ambulance, where her temperature was 36.9 °C (98.4 °F), pulse 116 beats/minute, blood pressure 125/72 mmHg, respirations 20 breaths/minute, and saturation 95% on room air, with no heart murmur heard, a few pulmonary rhonchi reported, and neurological examination reported as normal, with no abnormalities of mental status, pupillary reaction to light, cranial nerves, sensation or motor strength. Her hemoglobin was 9.5 g/dL, white blood cell count 14,200/cu mm (82% neutrophils, 11% lymphocytes, 6% monocytes, 1% eosinophils), platelets 389,000/cu mm, international normalized ratio 1.13, partial thromboplastin time 25 seconds, glucose 106 mg/dL, troponin <0.01 ng/mL and pro-brain natriuretic peptide 653 pcg/mL. She had sinus tachycardia on electrocardiogram. Portable chest radiograph showed diffuse ground-glass opacity in the right lung (Figure ). Computed tomography of the head without contrast showed a 4.5 x 2.2 x 2.3 cm parenchymal hemorrhage in the left occipital lobe, estimated volume 11.4 mL, with subdural extension up to 0.8 cm thick on the left and up to 0.6 cm thick on the right, extending into the upper cervical spinal canal (Figure ). The patient was started on levetiracetam, piperacillin-tazobactam, and vancomycin; she was then transferred to a larger hospital.
On admission to the larger hospital, no heart murmur was heard, the patient’s chest was reportedly clear, and she was alert and oriented. Her face was symmetric, her speech clear, her pupils 3 mm and reactive, handgrip strong bilaterally, upper extremity strength normal bilaterally, lower extremity strength “moderate” bilaterally, upper extremity sensation normal bilaterally, lower extremity sensation “full” bilaterally, and cranial nerves normal; gag, cough and bilateral corneal reflexes were present and Babinski signs absent. On hospital day two, magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography angiography confirmed the findings on the non-contrast computed tomography.
On hospital day three, cerebral angiogram showed a small 0.2 cm aneurysm of an abnormal distal left posterior cerebral artery vessel; the patient was taken to surgery, but the aneurysm was already occluded and there was no flow into the abnormal vessel. Blood cultures from the community hospital on day one were positive for Gram-positive cocci. Piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin were continued. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed severe mitral stenosis and regurgitation.
On hospital day four, cardiology was consulted and a cardiologist heard a grade 3/6 holosystolic murmur, best heard at the apex. A history of a heart murmur as a child was elicited from the family. Transesophageal echocardiogram showed a 1.37 x 0.263 cm pedunculated mass on the posterior wall of the left atrium (Figure ), a 0.298 cm lobule on the anterior leaflet of the mitral valve (Figure ), a stalk on the posterior leaflet of the mitral valve and severe mitral regurgitation. Occupational therapy was consulted and a right superior temporal visual field cut was diagnosed.
On hospital day six, the blood culture isolate was identified as a viridans streptococcus. Ceftriaxone was substituted for piperacillin-tazobactam and vancomycin. History of Janeway lesions was added to the patient’s problem list. On hospital day eight, a dentist consultant elicited a history of severe dental infection requiring the extraction of multiple teeth. Follow-up cerebral angiogram was all negative. On day 10, the patient was discharged with a principal diagnosis of endocarditis, a diagnosis of non-rheumatic mitral valve insufficiency, and ongoing intravenous ceftriaxone therapy.
Ten weeks later, on May 24, the patient underwent minimally invasive mitral valve repair with P2 resection, P1-P3 sliding plasty and placement of a saddle ring, which was successful. One year later, the patient was alive and well, in regular follow-up care.","

He had morning stiffness and pain lasting several hours and denied ocular irritation, melena, skin rash, or history of sexually transmitted disease. He had some difficulty dressing himself including closing shirt buttons and tying shoes. He was diagnosed with polyarticular, RF positive, ACPA positive rheumatoid arthritis. He was started on methotrexate 17.5 mg orally weekly, folic acid, and prednisone. He used naproxen as needed. His symptoms did not improve, so he was started on sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine. Approximately eight months later, his arthritis was well controlled with methotrexate, low-dose oral prednisone (2 mg daily), and naproxen as needed; both sulfasalazine and hydroxychloroquine were discontinued.
One day he developed sudden, severe abdominal pain. X-rays in the emergency department identified mildly prominent loops of small bowel and a few scattered air-fluid levels, consistent with mild ileus. CT abdomen/pelvis without contrast showed perforated solitary sigmoid colonic diverticula with pneumoperitoneum; there was no abscess (). He underwent urgent partial colectomy with diverting colostomy. Pathology revealed a lesion with hemorrhagic and granular mucosa, consistent with diverticulitis. There were no other diverticula. Over the next year, he underwent a colostomy take-down and reanastomosis with loop ileostomy and then finally ileostomy reversal.

CR_ENG_287,English,"A 22-year-old woman who lost her maxillary right central and lateral incisor prosthesis presented to the Gangneung-Wonju National University Dental Hospital for treatment (). The prosthesis was lost with severe secondary caries around the metal post. Each root canal was incompletely filled with a radiopaque resinous hard material, and the right lateral incisor root had apical rarefying osteitis (). Extraction was necessary due to the large extent of secondary caries and the nonremovable canal filling material. A white spot was found in the maxillary left central incisor with poor oral hygienic control.
Because the patient refused tooth preparation, restoring the teeth with an implant prosthesis was planned. A diagnostic waxing of the teeth determined the installing site of implants to meet the esthetic needs and to fabricate a radiographic stent and a surgical stent. Six weeks after extraction, severe bone loss of the buccal plate was confirmed (). In view of the insufficient implant primary stability, guided bone regeneration was performed as defects were filled with a xenograft material (Bioss; Geistlich Pharma AG, Wolhusen, Switzerland) and covered with a resorbable bilayer collagen membrane (Bio-gide; Geistlich Pharma AG) (). Four months after guided bone regeneration, sufficient hard and soft tissue volume was acquired. A tapered internal hex titanium implants (Implantium; Dentium, Seoul, Korea) were installed, oriented by a surgical guide. An acrylic resin RPD was fabricated to replace the missing tooth during the healing period.
Six month after implant placement, a tissue-punch technique was used to place a screw-retained provisional restoration with a provisional plastic abutment (Plastic temporary abutment, Dentium). The treatment for the white spot of the left maxillary central incisor was also needed. Diagnosis for the white spot was performed with visual-tactile inspection evaluating change of the surface gloss and color after dessication. The lesion surface was hard and shiny, it was diagnosed as an inactive ICDAS (International Caries Detection and Assessment System) code 2 which requires esthetic improvement only. Regenerating the white spot on the prosthesis was not esthetic and removal of the white spot lesion was thus required. Gingival recession after a surgical procedure highlights the white spot in the cervical area (). Furthermore, bandlike whitish discoloration along the perikymata in the middle third coronal area also needed esthetic enhancement. The proposed minimally invasive technique is based on a combined approach of bleaching, resin infiltration and composite resin bonding. In-office bleaching treatment was applied according to the manufacturer's (Lumawhite; Luma Lite, Spring Valley, CA, USA) recommendations. After gingival tissues were isolated using a light-polymerized resin dam (Opal Dam; Ultradent Products Inc., South Jardan, UT, USA), 35% hydrogen peroxide (Lumawhite) was applied onto the left maxillary incisor with consistent coverage of 2 to 3 mm thickness for 8 minutes, for a total of 3 times (). Two weeks after treatment, the white spot lesion was still apparent though bleaching became effective on the normal tooth structure, requiring more effective treatment ().
Consequently, the decision was made to conduct the resin infiltration technique as it was more preservative than microabrasion or macroabrasion. On the enamel surface, careful application of 15% hydrochloric acid gel (ICON-Etch; DMG, Hamburg, Germany) was performed for 120 seconds to remove the surface layer less than 30 to 40 µm (). The acid gel was suctioned and washed away thoroughly. The lesions were desiccated using ethanol (ICON-Dry; DMG) for 30 seconds. At the moment of applying ethanol, the color change in the white spot lesion was confirmed with ethanol penetration. After thorough dessication with ethanol, an infiltrant resin (ICON-Infiltrant; DMG) was placed on the tooth surface for 3 minutes for inside penetration. Excessive resin was wiped away from the surface and the proximal spaces. Light polymerizing was performed for 40 seconds. Applying the infiltrant resin was repeated to compensate for the shrinkage after polymerization. The tooth surface was polished with polishing discs (Sof-lex disk; 3M ESPE, Saint Paul, MN, USA). After resin infiltration, some of the cervical white spot and bandlike whitish discoloration along the perikymata in the middle third coronal area disappeared (). However, resin infiltration in some parts of the cervical white spot lesion was ineffective, requiring an advanced approach.
The limited, unchanged white spot lesion was removed with a carbide bur (Carbide Burs Round; Mani Inc., Tochigi, Japan). The tooth structure was etched with 38% phosphoric acid (Scotchbond Etchant; 3M ESPE) for 15 seconds. The etching gel was washed away and dried. A bonding agent (Adper Single Bond Plus adhesive, 3M ESPE) was applied to the preparation area and light polymerized for 10 seconds. Composite resin (Filtek Supreme XT; 3M ESPE) was placed and polymerized for 40 seconds. Finally, polishing the restoration surface was performed with polishing discs (Sof-lex disk; 3M ESPE) ().
A complete maxillary arch impression was made with a silicone impression material (Exafine, GC, Tokyo, Japan). A customized abutment (Direct Casting Abutment; Dentium) was fabricated. Shade information was transferred to the dental laboratory after taking clinical photos with a shade guide (VitaLumin shade guide; VidentInc, Brea, CA, USA) and a detailed shade map (). A metal ceramic fixed dental prosthesis was cemented with implant cement (Premier Implant Cement; Premier Products Co., Plymouth Meeting, PA, USA) ().
The patient was followed for oral hygiene instruction and no complications were found after 6 months (). However, due to insufficient long term clinical research on color stability for resin infiltration treatment, continuous post-treatment monitoring should be followed. It is also important to monitor the maintenance of proper surface gloss, oral hygiene and health of peri-implant soft and hard tissue.","

CR_ENG_291,English,"A 77-year-old gentleman had sudden-onset right-sided weakness for 38 min duration with dysarthria. At presentation, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) was 11. His blood pressure was 146 / 84 mm of Hg, pulse 88 per minute, regular and normal volume. He was conscious and obeying commands. A diagnosis of acute stroke was made in emergency triage and brain rescue code was activated. Urgent noncontrast computed tomography (CT) of the head and computed tomography angiography (CTA) was performed. CT head revealed no intracranial hemorrhage, and the Alberta Stroke Program Early CT score was 9 []. Perfusion map showed small area of mismatch deficit (penumbra) in the left middle cerebral artery territory involving anterior temporal lobe and internal capsule [Figure -]. CTA did not reveal any major vessel occlusion, no aneurysm, or any feature of vasculitis. Basic investigation revealed normal coagulogram (international normalized ratio: 0.8), euglycemic (blood sugar: 134 mg%), and platelet count of 280 × 103/ml. After informed consent, he was thrombolyzed with TNK (body weight: 68 kg, TNK dose 17 mg, given intravenously over 1 min) in the CT suite. The patient was shifted to the stroke care unit for close monitoring of vitals and NIHSS. After approximately 10 min, the patient complained of severe headache and vomiting, followed by deep in sensorium. His NIHSS score increased to 20. Urgent portable CT head was performed, which showed diffuse SAH [Figure and ]. He was intubated for poor respiratory effort and reduced Glasgow Coma Scale. Activated prothrombin complex concentrates and cryoprecipitate was given without delay. Digital subtraction angiography of the cerebral vessel was done, but did not reveal any underlying aneurysm or other abnormality [Figure and ]. He was managed conservatively for SAH with close monitoring for vasospasm. Repeat CT head showed improving SAH, no hydrocephalus []. The patient was discharged after 2 weeks with Modified Rankin Scale (mRS) 4 and continued on medical therapy (aspirin 75 mg started after SAH resolved) and intensive physiotherapy. Six-week follow-up showed improvement of the right-sided deficit with mRS 3.","

CR_ENG_292,English,"A 44-year-old otherwise healthy male was referred to the orthopaedic unit with a four week history of minor pain in the right upper arm. The onset of pain was accompanied by an episode of flu-like symptoms that subsided immediately. Later, an indolent swelling was noted on the lateral side of the upper arm. Increasing numbness in the lateral forearm and hand finally encouraged the patient to consult his practitioner.
The physical examination indicated a palpable, indolent soft tissue tumour located at the dorso-lateral, distal side of the right humerus. The localisation of the numb area reported by the patient corresponded to area of the radial nerve´s sensible innervation. A blood sample was taken and revealed mild anaemia (Hb 13,0 mg/dl [norm: 14–18 mg/dl]), moderate leucocytosis (11,46 G/l [norm: 4,0–9,0 G/l]) and slightly elevated CRP (1,8 mg/dl [norm: <0,5 mg/dl]) and CK (232 U/l [norm: <174 U/l]). Subsequently, X-rays of the right humerus showed cortical disaggregation and extraosseal soft tissue swelling (Figure ) and were highly indicative for malignancy. MRI of the right upper arm revealed an inhomogenous tumour affecting the dia- and metaphysis of the right humerus (normal marrow displaced, T1 and T2 hyperintense noduli). The corticalis was infiltrated and permeated, leading to a small extraosseal tumour mass (15 × 6 mm) on the dorsolateral side of the bone. This tumour mass led to a compression of the radial nerve (Figure ).
Therefore, an open biopsy of the proximal diaphysis of the right humerus was performed. After drilling into the bone, spontaneous extrusion of purulence was evident. Microbiological samples were takenand the marrow space rinsed and drained (Figure ). Calculated antibiotic treatment with Cefuroxim (4,5 g/d i.v.) was initiated and switched to Ceftriaxone (2 g/d i.v.) after Streptococcus pneumoniae was identified. Screening for infections causing immunodeficiency (HIV, Hep. B, Hep. C, EBV, CMV, Mycobacteria) was negative. Congenital asplenia was ruled out by a routine ultrasound check-up. A pharyngeal swab did not show local colonisation with S. pneumoniae and pathologies of the lungs including clinical unapparent pneumonia were excluded by chest X-ray.
The patient was discharged on the 10th postoperative day showing no signs of infection. Antimicrobiotic treatment was changed to Cefuroxim 1000 mg/d p.o. and continued for four weeks. Following check-ups after 30 days, 3 months and 9 months did not result in any pathological finding. Clinically, the scar tissue showed no signs of persistent infection, the patient did not report any pain in the shoulder or arm and the function of the limb was normal. The white blood cell count was normal at discharge and stayed normal during the whole follow up. CRP at discharge was slightly elevated (1,1 mg/dl [norm: <0,5 mg/dl]), at 30 days it decreased to 0,3 mg/dl and stayed below 0,5 mg/dl thereafter. We performed X-rays of the humerus after 30 days and a control MRI-scan after 3 months. Both revealed no signs of osteonecrosis complicating the infection.
Acute osteomyelitis in adults is rare and generally linked to immunodeficiency, diabetes, vasculopathy, precedent trauma or surgery []. A haematogenous spread of bacteria leading to osteomyelitis is mostly seen in prepubescent children or elderly patients and is characterised by nidation of bacteria within bones without direct trauma or open wound []. Haematogenous osteomyelitis is well known as being the most common musculoskeletal complication in patients with HIV or AIDS []. However, in the literature there is not one single case of acute, haematogenous pneumococcal osteomyelitis affecting long bones in an otherwise healthy adult patient who lacks trauma history or immunodeficiency.
Bacteria causing haematogenous osteomyelitis reflect their frequency in the blood as a function of age [,]. Thus, organisms most commonly encountered in infants and neonates include Staphylococcus aureus, group B streptococci, coagulase-negative staphylococci and different other streptococci [-]. With age, S. aureus dominates. In elderly people, commonly subject to gram-negative bacteremia, osteomyelitis - especially vertebral osteomyelitis - can also be caused by this group of microorganisms []. Pneumococci as uncommon infectious agent of the bone are rarely known to cause vertebral osteomyelitis [,-]. Pneumococcal bone manifestations are generally linked to clinically apparent upper and lower respiratory tract infections caused by S. pneumoniae, sickle cell anemia [] or direct bone trauma [,]. Asplenia is also associated with an increased risk of severe pneumococcal infections, thus predisposing for affecting the bone via haematogenous spread []. All mentioned co-factors were missing in this particular case.
The clinical features of haematogenous, acute osteomyelitis in long bones are typical: chills, fever, and malaise reflect the bacteremic spread of microorganisms as shown by positive blood cultures. Strong pain and local swelling are hallmarks of the local infectious process. The clinical examination should include a search for bone tenderness on palpitation []. By contrast, in our case the clinical symptoms were a painless swelling and nerve disfunction, being strongly suggestive for a continuously growing process commonly found in primary bone tumours or metastases.
Distinguishing between subclinical haematogenous osteomyelitis and primary or metastatic bone tumours by imaging can be challenging [,]. The earliest radiographic changes in osteomyelitis are swelling of soft tissue, periosteal thickening or focal osteopenia, which is frequently observed in malignant bone tumours as well [,]. The typical appearance of acute osteomyelitis in MRI is a localized area of abnormal marrow with decreased signal intensity in T1-weighted images and increased signal intensity in T2-weighted images [], as shown in our case. MRI is highly sensitive in the detection of pathologic changes in bone marrow and can give precise information about the localization and extent of an infection, but it has not yet provided pathognomonic findings for osteomyelitis []. Thus, the presence of a primary or metastatic bone tumour had to be excluded by open biopsy.
Recommendations concerning antibiotic treatment of hematogenous osteomyelitis differ regionally according to the local type and resistance-pattern of the causing bacteria. In Germany, the Paul-Ehrlich society would favour a combination of 2nd generation cephalosporin with clindamycin as first-line calculated therapy in adults, assuming that the infection is most likely be caused by S. aureus or β-haemolysing streptococci []. In pediatric osteomyelitis, up to 5% of all cases were identified to be caused by S. pneumoniae[]. S. aureus as the top-isolate and also pneumococci do respond to a first line antibiotic treatment with a 1st generation cephalosporin, clindamycin or high-dose penicillin G according to most authors [-]. Notably, S. pneumoniae has been shown to have a lower minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) to penicillin than other streptococci (e.g. S. pyogenes), though the clinical impact is questionable and depends on the breakpoint used. Altogether, resistant strains are not frequent and account for only 0.24% []. Unlike in adult osteomyelitis, no extensive surgical therapy is required in children. However, it is also important to gain representative tissue samples from the bone to be able to initiate targeted therapy after culture []. The duration of the antibiotic treatment should be 1–3 months. Recent studies challenged this approach and suggest that 20 days of treatment including an initial i.v. period of 2–4 days should be sufficient to control the infection [].
Invasive pneumococcal infections in adults are rare and generally affect immunodeficient patients. Resistance-patterns to antibiotics vary regionally and depend on the breakpoint of the MIC-definition used. In most countries high-dose parenteral penicillin G or cefuroxim are recommended as first-line therapy. Cefriaxone has been shown to have one of the lowest MICs making this substance effective, especially in the treatment of severe pneumococcal infections [,]. Specific treatment recommendations for pneumococcal osteomyelitis in adults are completely missing. On the basis that ceftriaxone is a very effective substance against other severe pneumococcal infections in pediatric and aduld patients [,] we adopted this substance once the bacteria was identified and were able to control the symptoms within a short period. Retrospectively, one can assume that high-dose penicillin G would have had the same efficacy. In addition, the continuation of cefuroxime, probably combined with clindamycin would have been another reasonable alternative.
According to recent treatment guidelines, the initial i.v. therapy of hematogenous osteomyelitis should last for 1–4 weeks and should be continued by p.o. therapy for 2–6 weeks []. Since our patient received i.v. therapy for only 10 days, the total duration of therapy was rather short. However, since all inflammatory parameters were within the normal range and clinical inspection did also not reveal symptoms of infection 30 days after discharge, we stopped therapy at this time point. As given above, therapy for uncomplicated cases of osteomyelitis in children is even shorter [,]. 2nd and 3rd generation cephalosporins were identified as major risk factors for developing pseudomembranotic colitis, especially in combination with clindamycin [,]. We therefore decided to use the 2nd generation cephalosporin alone for ambulatory treatment.","

CR_ENG_295,English,"A 65-year-old female presented to the emergency room with uncontrolled abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting. Medical history was significant for Type 2 diabetes mellitus, previous intestinal intussusceptions, and moderate abdominal pain. Initial abdominal CT scan indicated a small bowel obstruction with a transition point at the jejunal area []. Related to this finding were mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the right pelvic region. Differential diagnosis included small bowel neoplasm, adhesions, or a reactive intestinal inflammatory process.
Shortly after presentation, the patient's clinical condition worsened, requiring emergency small bowel resection. Histological analysis of the resected bowel segments demonstrated small intestinal mucosa with intraepithelial and mucosal infiltrates of benign CD3 (+) T-cells, consistent with celiac sprue. Also found were medium-sized infiltrating lymphocytes with characteristic pleomorphic nuclei and prominent nucleoli. Immunohistochemical stains revealed tumor cells positive for CD-3, weakly positive for BCL-2, and negative for CD5, CD20, CD10 and cyclin-D1. Immunohistochemical analysis for Ki-67 showed a markedly increased proliferative index, with 90% of lymphocytes staining positive []. Polymerase chain reaction analysis for T-cell receptor-gamma gene rearrangement was positive, demonstrating the presence of a clonal population of T-cells. The combined morphological and immunophenotypic features of this lesion were consistent with jejunal EATL. Further systemic investigations were all non-contributory. The patient was discharged and the recommended treatment for her primary condition was chemotherapy.

CR_ENG_298,English,"A 43-year-old man, impacted in his chest by a car accident, complained of severe chest pain in his anterior chest wall with palpable sternal instability. Computed tomography (CT) of the chest showed a displaced compound mid-body sternal fracture (). Troubled with fracture of several cervical bones accompanied by sternal fracture, he was scheduled for open sternal fixation 3 days after the trauma because of combined operation with spine surgery. Open reduction and internal fixation of the sternum was performed using the SternaLock system (Biomet Microfixation Inc., Jacksonville, FL, USA).
After a midline longitudinal incision over the sternum, the fracture site was carefully debrided of any fibrous union and old hematoma to expose healthy bone. Before plate fixation, manual reduction of the sternal fracture was assisted by the use of bone reduction forceps placed within the surrounding intercostal spaces. Three 4-holed straight plates were used vertically and horizontally due to compound sternal fracture (), manually contoured to the underlying sternum, and secured using self-drilling, self-tapping screws. The screw length was 10 mm, which was chosen by the thickness of the sternum (as measured on chest CT) at each point of screw placement. The wound was irrigated and closed. The patient was not discharged because he was receiving rehabilitation treatment for his leg, which had been paralyzed due to the cervical spine trauma. The 3-month follow-up demonstrated normal wound healing with no complaints of symptoms associated with instability. The repair was palpably stable and non-tender.","

CR_ENG_300,English,"A 46-year-old Brahmin woman with a history of a hormone receptor-negative invasive ductal type of adenocarcinoma of her left breast (stage pT3N3aM0) presented with pain and blurring of vision of her right eye.
Diagnosis of left-sided stage IIIc breast carcinoma was made 2 years ago when she developed pain in her left arm. She subsequently underwent a left-sided modified radical mastectomy. Postoperatively she started treatment with docetaxel 80 mg, adriamycin 60 mg, and cyclophosphamide 600 mg. After completion of six cycles of chemotherapy, external beam radiation of her thoracic wall was performed once a week for 8 weeks.
Two years after initial diagnosis, she presented with temporal headache and pain on temporal aspect of her right eye. Visual acuity in her right eye was “counting fingers” close to face and 6/9 in her left eye. A slit lamp examination revealed a tender subconjunctival swelling with localized congestion in superotemporal aspect of her right eye underneath the upper eyelid (Fig. ). With this finding alone, an initial clinical diagnosis of anterior scleritis was made until posterior segment was examined. Her pupil was sluggishly reactive with no relative afferent pupillary defect (RAPD).
Fundus evaluation under mydriasis revealed a shallow retinal detachment with underlying amelanotic subretinal mass, superotemporal to macula, causing retinal folds in macular area. A shallow serous inferior retinal detachment could be appreciated inferior to inferotemporal arcade (Fig. ). Intraocular pressures were normal in both her eyes (10 mm of Hg in right eye and 16 mm of Hg in left eye).
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) orbit revealed a 2 × 1 cm subretinal mass in superior and temporal aspect of her right eye with enhancement after injection of contrast (Fig. ). The lesion was of high intensity in T2-weighted images. Brain imaging was normal.
Following this, computed tomography (CT) of her chest was done which showed metastasis in both lungs, mediastinal lymphadenopathy, and right-sided pleural effusion (Fig. ).","

CR_ENG_301,English,"A 30-year-old male with no previous medical history presented with complaints of radicular pain along the buttock, on the posterior aspect of the thigh lateral to the left foot, along the course of the left sciatic nerve of 4 months duration. Except for a restricted left-sided straight leg raise test, the neurological examination showed no abnormality. Radiographs of the lumbosacral spine did not reveal any significant changes. A provisional clinical diagnosis of lumbar disc syndrome was made. Patient was started on symptomatic treatment, but reported no relief of his symptoms over a period of 6 weeks, with persistence of tension signs, and was out of his job during this period.
Computed tomography (CT) scan carried out revealed a hypodense, enhancing lesion in the left L5–S1 neural foramen with the widening of the foramen and “scalloping” of the posterior vertebral surface []. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed the same lesion that was hypointense on T1 and hyperintense on T2, with a peripheral ring enhancement after gadolinium injection. These features suggested a schwannoma. The rest of the disco-vertebral structures were intact [].
A left L5 laminectomy and left-sided foraminotomy were done to expose the tumor mass. A round mass involving the S1 nerve root in the foraminal region was isolated and extirpated. The tumor was adequately separated from the remaining neural tissue by careful dissection along the capsule; no instrumentation was needed. Histological examination of the excised tissue suggested a benign schwannoma []. Postoperatively, the patient had immediate relief of radicular symptoms and had a pain-free straight leg raise test. He was discharged home without any motor deficit. One-month postoperative MRI showed total resection of the schwannoma [].","

CR_ENG_305,English,"This 43-year-old male without systemic disease complained of blurred vision progressively for almost six months. Bilateral visual field defects were found under visual field examination. The patient’s high cortical functions were intact. Cranial nerve function was also normal, except for bilateral lower temporal hemiapnosia. Anatomical MRI revealed a mass lesion over sellar and suprasellar regions with heterogeneous contrast enhancement, and a cystic component that caused upward compression of the optic chiasm (Figure ). Endocrinological data included pre-operative serum measurements of growth hormone (GH), insulin-like growth factor-1, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), cortisol, prolactin (PRL), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), free T4, thyrotropin-stimulating hormone (TSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and testosterone, all of which were at normal levels.
After the provisional diagnosis of craniopharyngioma with optic nerve compression, we performed endoscopic trans-sphenoidal surgery (ETS) for tumor removal. We used a standard one-surgeon, two-hand technique via a single nostril, with the endoscope mounted on a pneumatic scope holder. A vertical linear mucosal incision was made with electric cautery near the root of the bony nasal septum. A nasal speculum was placed after dilatation of the space and fracture of the bony nasal septum without destruction of the middle turbinate. Subsequently, posterior septectomy was performed with removal of the anterior portion of the vomer bone using high-speed drills and Kerrison rongeurs. The bony septum inside the sphenoid sinus and the rostrum of sphenoid bone were removed to expose the sella turcica. The floor of the pituitary fossa was removed after confirmation of anatomy via the intraoperative navigation system or lateral skull fluoroscopy. A soft density tumor with some yellowish particles was removed endoscopically with ring curettes over the sellar region. The cystic part of the tumor with old blood content was drained during surgery. The tumor was completely removed with the diaphragm sella intact and without cerebrospinal fluid leakage. The sellar floor was reconstructed using with tissue glue and autologous bone grafts harvested during the approach. The patient had no neurological deficit after surgery. No electrolyte imbalance, diabetes insipitus (DI) sign, or hormone deficiency was noted. The original visual field defect also improved after surgery. Post-operative images indicated no residual or recurrent tumor within the two-year follow-up period (Figure ).
Microscopic examination revealed that the tumor was composed of delicate fibrovascular cores covered by a single layer of cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells (Figure ). There are no anaplastic features identified. The tumor cells were immunoreactive for cytokeratin AE1/AE3 and epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), focally positive for S-100, and non-reactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (Figures -). Immunohistochemical stain with multiple pituitary hormones, including ACTH, PRL, FSH, LH, GH, and TSH, was negative. Based on these results, we diagnosed CPP.","

CR_ENG_306,English,"A 57-year-old man presented to the emergency room with a several-day history of shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness, bilateral limb discomfort, and unilateral hearing loss. He also complained of cold intolerance and sluggish speech and movement that started a few weeks earlier, as well as 2-kg weight gain over the past year. He started rosuvastatin (5 mg, once daily) a year ago, with no dose adjustment; the patient was diagnosed with hypothyroidism at the same time. He was recommended levothyroxine treatment but did not initiate treatment because he had no related symptoms or discomfort in his daily life.
General physical examination revealed dry skin, neck vein distension, nontender diffuse goiter around the neck, and myxedema with puffy face, bilateral periorbital and lower extremities edema. His pulse rate was 52 beats/minute, blood pressure was 114/82 mmHg, respiratory rate was 20 breaths/minute, and his body temperature was 37.1 °C. Muffled heart sounds without fine crackle were also detected.
The initial results of laboratory tests (Table ) were as follows: BUN 19.0 (7–23) mg/dL, creatinine 1.5 (0.7–1.4) mg/dL, creatine kinase 9300 (43–198) IU/L, lactate dehydrogenase 1876 (238–422) IU/L, myoglobulin 636 (28–72) ng/mL, alanine aminotransferase 357 (3–45) IU/L, aspartate aminotransferase 278 (3–45) IU/L, creatine kinase muscle-brain fraction (CK-MB) 52.07 (0–4.87) U/L, troponin I 0.057 (0–0.014) ng/mL, total cholesterol 222 (130–240) mg/dL, low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) 136 (50–160) mg/dL, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c) 74 (40–85) mg/dL, and triglycerides 127 (35–200) mg/dL. The results of thyroid function tests showed TSH > 100 (0.17–4.05) μIU/mL, fT4 0.32 (0.89–1.79) μIU/mL, and triiodothyronine (T3) 55.6 (78–182) ng/dL. On chest radiography, heart shadow was not blunted without pulmonary infiltration, and cardiomegaly was seen (cardiothoracic ratio, 66%; Fig. a). An electrocardiogram showed bradycardia with normal sinus rhythm and low QRS voltage, and transthoracic echocardiography revealed a moderate amount of pericardial effusion (posterior 15 mm) with preserved left ventricular systolic function (55–60%; Fig. c). On further investigation, pure tone audiometry revealed that the patient had profound unilateral sensorineural hearing loss (Fig. a), and thyroid sonography showed diffusely enlarged gland with a heterogeneous echotexture and decreased vascularity (Fig. ); these findings are consistent with Hashimoto thyroiditis together with elevated thyroid peroxidase antibodies (> 2000 [0–5.61] IU/mL) and antithyroglobulin antibodies (9143.72 [0–4.11] IU/mL).
Upon admission, we started aggressive intravenous fluid resuscitation to treat rhabdomyolysis with acute kidney injury and levothyroxine replacement (oral, 150 mcg/day) to treat hypothyroidism. We also started systemic corticosteroids and intratympanic steroid injection to treat sensorineural hearing loss. The patient did not require pericardiocentesis because there was no ventricular dysfunction, and his vital signs were comparatively stable. Over the next several days, the patient’s clinical symptoms, such as shortness of breath, general weakness, and lower limb discomfort, improved substantially. On consecutive laboratory tests, creatine kinase as well as lactate dehydrogenase began to decrease on hospital day (HD) 3 and continued to decline to 1530 IU/L and 1508 IU/L on HD 7, respectively. Creatinine also started to decrease by 1.11 mg/dL on HD 7 accompanied by creatine kinase decline. Further thyroid function testing showed that his TSH was 53.65 μIU/mL and fT4 was 0.63 μIU/mL on HD 7. The patient was discharged home on HD 10 with instructions to continue levothyroxine (150 mcg/day, oral).
The patient was examined in the outpatient clinic 2 weeks after discharge. We observed recovered creatinine and creatinine kinase (Table ) as well as improved cardiomegaly (Fig. b). Except for hearing loss, his clinical symptoms continued to improve, and he was compliant with levothyroxine treatment. His thyroid function was normalized at 5 months (TSH 0.10 μIU/mL, free T4 1.60 μIU/mL) and remained euthyroid status until one year after discharge (TSH 0.54 μIU/mL, free T4 1.52 μIU/mL). No pericardial effusion appeared on transthoracic echocardiography (Fig. d). Regarding hearing loss, there was slight improvement in follow-up pure tone audiometry after 1 year; nevertheless, profound unilateral hearing loss remained in this patient (Fig. b).","

CR_ENG_308,English,"A 44-year-old Caucasian woman presented with sudden onset central crushing chest pain, shortness of breath, and collapse. An ECG showed anterior ST elevation across leads V2–V5 () prompting management via the primary percutaneous angioplasty pathway. Past medical history was unremarkable except for recently diagnosed asthma, treated with inhaled corticosteroid and β-agonist. The patient did not have any risk factors for ischaemic heart disease. Cardiovascular examination was unremarkable and respiratory examination revealed bi-basal crepitations, more prominent on the left. Urgent coronary angiography showed unobstructed coronary arteries, with initial coronary artery spasm that resolved with intracoronary nitrate (). Troponin-T was 772 ng/L (normal range <14 ng/L) and a chest radiograph showed extensive left-sided consolidation (). A working diagnosis of myopericarditis secondary to pneumonia was made and the patient received intravenous co-amoxiclav with supportive treatment and monitoring.
Viral swabs and urinary antigens for atypical pneumonia were negative. Serological viral and autoimmune screens for myocarditis were negative and the patient did not improve despite antibiotic treatment. Peripheral blood counts revealed a white cell count of 17.34 × 109/L (normal range 3–10.5 × 109/L) consisting of an eosinophilia of 7.23 × 109 (normal range <0.5 × 109/L). The patient denied any recent travel history, had a stable weight and no bowel symptoms. A computed tomography (CT) pulmonary angiogram was undertaken which confirmed the consolidation seen on the chest x-ray, and showed multiple small filling defects suggestive of pulmonary emboli. A bronchoalveolar lavage showed abundant polymorphonuclear leucocytes, lymphocytes, macrophages, and bronchial epithelial and squamous cells, in keeping with acute inflammation, though no evidence of organisms or eosinophilic damage. Serum troponin-T remained elevated at 1131 ng/L.
A CMR was undertaken showing extensive myocardial oedema on multi-parametric native myocardial mapping, patchy subendocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) particularly in the apical segments and right ventricle, and a circumferential pericardial effusion (). These features were in keeping with a myopericarditis, but not indicating a specific underlying aetiology.
Taken together with the eosinophilia and late onset asthma, which was poorly responsive to standard inhaled treatment, but responsive to oral steroids, and CT sinus imaging revealing sinusitis and polyposis, the patient met the American College of Rheumatology diagnostic criteria for EGPA [asthma, eosinophilia (>10% of peripheral white cell count), pulmonary infiltrates, and paranasal sinus abnormalities].
The patient was treated with pulsed intravenous methylprednisolone (500 mg) once daily for 5 days and cyclophosphamide (15 mg/kg) and rapidly showed improvement clinically. She received a further five cycles of cyclophosphamide with tapering oral prednisolone and was initiated on azathioprine as a maintenance agent. The patient had a good response symptomatically, biochemically (normalized troponin-T), electrocardiographically, and radiologically.
Interval CMR imaging showed complete resolution of myocardial oedema () indicating a dramatic response to therapy. Some LGE remained in the apical segments which is likely representative of focal areas of fibrosis, but may also represent a limited area of infarct due to initial coronary vasospasm. Coronary vasculitis also remains a differential, but the response to intracoronary nitrate on angiogram would not be expected with vasculitis (). These findings suggest that fast administration of cyclophosphamide with high-dose steroids may reduce the burden of post-myocarditis fibrosis in EGPA. The patient was maintained on oral azathioprine and oral steroids were weaned off. She remains in clinical and radiological remission.","

CR_ENG_309,English,"A 17 year-old man, who visited to Anhui Chest Hospital in August 2014, presented with cough with sputum, breathless, and fever. Computed tomography (CT) images showed lung cancer in the right lung with lower lobes atelectasis. Tracheoscopy indicated malignant small round cell tumor. The values of serum tumor markers such as NSE, CEA, SSC, and Cyfra 21–1 were not remarkable. The patients had no history of smoking and no family history of cancer.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that the tumor was positive for CD99 (Fig. A, B), Syn, CD56, Ki 67, Vim, and S-100, but negative for Cg-A, myoD1, CK, Des, myogenin, and SMA. CD99 plays an important role and differentiating diagnosis from other small-round cell malignant tumors. The diagnosis of Ewing sarcoma/primitive neuroectodermal tumors was made due to CD99 positive expression (Fig. A, B).
Second-generation sequencing was used to detect the mutations of 16 tumor-related driver genes in peripheral blood and biopsies. The oncogenic mutation spectrum includes BRAF 54, EGFR 66, KIT 36, KRAS 34, PDGFRA 23, PIK3CA 29, CSF1R 7, ERBB2 16, FLT3 24, KDR 11, MET 9, NRAS 27, RET 13, SMO 5, SRC 1, and TP53. In these genes, 428 known-mutation regions were detected, and 5 mutations were present, including 4 mutations in uncommon mutation regions and 1 mutation in known mutation region (Table ). All these mutations were synonymous mutations. No missense mutation and abnormal proteins were found.
The patient received chemotherapy and radiation therapy immediately after diagnosis. Although the initial treatment with VAC-IE (intensive vincristine + ifosfamide + etoposide + cyclophosphamide + doxorubicin) resulted in partial response, the treatment failed and the disease was progressive (Table ). After 2nd-line chemotherapy of GP (gemcitabine + cisplatin) failed (Table ), the patient was transferred from Shanghai Tumor Hospital to our hospital on September 3, 2015. However, TI (temozolomide + irinotecan) failed to improve the patient's condition, and the patient's health condition continued to deteriorate. The patient then received 3 cycle of chemotherapy TI (Table ) plus thalidomide as salvage therapy. All the symptoms including pant, cough, and expectoration were relieved. During the follow-up period, he was given with monotherapy thalidomide (200 mg/day for 21 days) and remained in a good condition. Ethical approval was given by the medical Ethics Committee of Xuzhou Central Hospital, and the patient has signed the informed consent form.
The initial thoracicoabdominal CT scan showed a soft tissue mass with 88 mm × 82 mm in size in the right lung (Fig. A). The mediastinum was shifted to the right side, and mediastinal lymphadenopathy was found with pericardial effusion and pleural effusion. In contrast, recent CT results showed that the mass was decreased dramatically (Fig. B).
The patient now was alive with no sign of recurrence and went back to the normal life and social activities. He was followed up regularly at our outpatient clinic. He presented with no obvious symptoms such as cough, expectoration, and fever. He received maintenance dose of thalidomide (200 mg/day). Except mild hair loss, no obvious thalidomide-associated side effects such as rash, fatigue, thrombosis, and leukopenia occurred. The patient survived for 30 months till the last follow-up in March 2017.","

CR_ENG_310,English,"A 49-year-old female, gravida 5, para 3, presented with dysuria and hematuria. Her past medical, surgical, gynecological, and family histories were all unremarkable. Her menstrual cycle was irregular. A bimanual pelvic examination identified a movable mass in the left adnexal region. Vaginal ultrasound confirmed the presence of a polycystic mass of 67 x 57 mm in diameter without a solid component, suggestive of ovarian tumor (Figure
). Ascites was absent, and there were no abnormal findings of the uterus and right adnexae. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) showed a multilocular cystic mass with a fat component (Figure
). The serum tumor marker levels were within the normal ranges: CA125; 20.0U/mL (normal <35.0), CA19-9; 3.8 U/mL (normal <37.0), SCC; 1.1ng/mL (normal <1.5), except for carcinoembrionic antigen (CEA); 6.9ng/mL (normal <5.0). The diagnosis of left ovarian MCT was made based on these data, and laparoscopic surgery was planned.
An exploratory laparoscopy revealed an enlarged left ovary (80mm × 70mm). The surface of the tumor was smooth and well-circumscribed. There was no adherence to any other pelvic organs. A small amount of ascites was detected, and the cytology of ascites was negative for malignancy. A laparoscopic left salpingo-oophorectomy was performed, and the intraoperative diagnosis of frozen sections was suspicious of borderline malignancy. Therefore, we changed the procedure to a laparotomy and abdominal simple total hysterectomy, and a right salpingo-oophorectomy and partial omentectomy were carried out. The patient’s postoperative course was uneventful. The pathological findings revealed the tumor to be adenocarcinoma of the intestinal type arising from a MCT. The serum level of CEA was normalized 7 days after surgery. We explained to the patient that there was no evidence about the need for adjuvant therapy because the disease is extremely rare. She decided not to receive adjuvant therapy. The patient had no recurrence of the disease as of 5 years after the surgery.","

CR_ENG_312,English,"An 18-year-old girl presented with frequent micturition for the past 2 years causing severe personal and social impairment. She was evaluated by several physicians and urologists, who could not attribute any organic cause to her symptom. The patient was finally referred to the Department of Psychiatry for further evaluation.
On careful review of the history, it was found that she had severe compulsion to urinate frequently. The compulsive urge was secondary to an underlying obsession of something going wrong if she would not go to the toilet. The compulsions had gradually increased which led to increased frequency of micturition. This was in the absence of polydipsia, dysuria, hesitancy, or any other features of organicity. Mental state examination revealed her to be very anxious and at times agitated. She had sexual and contamination obsessions. However, her main distress was the compulsion to frequently urinate. These symptoms made her feel dysphoric. Baseline Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score was 29 indicating severe OCD. She was referred to the Department of Urology to rule out organicity beyond any doubt. Urodynamic studies revealed an underactive detrusor, which was the result of frequently emptying the bladder causing a decrease in the bladder capacity. She was advised of only psychological management by the urologists.
She was started on fluoxetine with which she had improved partially with a dose of 40 mg/day. She was unable to tolerate higher doses due to gastrointestinal side effects. She was later started on tab sertraline up to 200 mg daily after gradual titration.[] Aripiprazole was added as an augmentation agent considering severe agitation, dysphoria, and insomnia. Aripiprazole was gradually built up to 7.5 mg at bedtime.[]
Patient and relatives were not willing for inpatient admission for a full trial of cognitive behavior therapy, so she was treated as an outpatient. Good rapport was established with the patient. She received three sessions of exposure response prevention after her dysphoria and agitation settled. She showed dramatic improvement in the severity of anxiety and ability to resist compulsion. Aripiprazole was gradually tapered and stopped after 6 weeks. Her YBOCS score at the end of 8 weeks was zero indicating complete remission. She had improved in her personal and social functioning.","

CR_ENG_313,English,"A 43-year-old male presented to our hospital with complaints of recurrent high fever for a few weeks. On an Urgent Care visit eight weeks prior to presentation, the patient was found to be positive for influenza. He was thereafter treated with Levaquin for persistent febrile episodes, later requiring hospitalization during which work-up revealed pancytopenia and hyperferritinemia. On computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen, multiple hypodense dense lesions were seen within the spleen with the largest one in the medial posterior part measuring 4.5 × 3.8 cm, and right inguinal lymphadenopathy. A bone marrow aspirate smear was adequately cellular with left shifted myeloid and erythroid maturation. A histiocyte with hemophagocytosis was seen. There was no evidence of malignancy. The patient was subsequently discharged from the facility and was scheduled for a CT-guided lymph node biopsy.
Four days later, the patient presented to our emergency department with a fever of 105°F. CBC revealed pancytopenia with a total white count of 1 × 109 cells/L, hemoglobin of 7 g/dL, and a platelet count of 60 × 109/L. Renal function and electrolytes were normal. Total bilirubin was 1.4 mg/dL, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase were normal. Uric acid was 1.7 mg/dL, LDH 913 U/L, triglycerides 302 mg/dL, PT 14.7 seconds, and PTT 39 seconds. CT of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast revealed multiple enlarged abdominal lymph nodes including perigastric and pancreatic lymph nodes measuring up to 2.2 cm and retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy including a large retrocaval lymph node measuring up to 3.6 cm. There was a right inguinal conglomerate of lymph nodes measuring up to 6.6 × 4.1 cm. The spleen was enlarged with diffuse enhancement. There was no focal hepatic lesion identified. Further work-up revealed an elevated D-dimer at 7123 ng/mL and ferritin 24,247 ng/mL. Haptoglobin was less than 20 mg/dL. Rheumatologic work-up including anti-CCP antibody, SSA and B, ANA, ANCA, anti-myeloperoxidase antibody, and rheumatoid factor was negative. Viral serology including HIV and hepatitis B and C was negative. Soluble IL-2 receptor alpha was elevated at 9726 U/mL (Normal 406–100 U/mL).
The differential diagnosis at this point included a lymphoproliferative disorder, hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis, or other inflammatory disorder. The patient had an excisional biopsy of the right inguinal lymph node that showed effacement of normal nodal architecture. The cellular elements comprised predominantly of small lymphoid cells and histiocytes with scattered large atypical cells. These atypical cells showed irregular nuclei with distinct nucleoli. Immunophenotypically, they were positive for CD20, PAX5, OCT2, BCL6, and MUM1 while they were negative for CD10, CD15, and CD30. In situ hybridization for EBV encoded RNA (EBER) was negative. The background small lymphocytes consisted mostly of T cells and histiocytes. While numerous small and some large B cells were seen in the abnormal follicles surrounding the atypical infiltrate, they were absent in the diffuse histiocyte rich areas. Small T cells positive for CD3, CD2, CD5, CD7, and CD43 were present both in the abnormal follicles and the histiocyte infiltrate. Ki 67 staining was approximately 30% with preferential staining of the larger cells []. The slides were sent for a second opinion and the overall findings were supportive of a diagnosis of T cell histiocyte rich large B cell lymphoma.
The patient was started on dexamethasone 20 mg given intravenously daily. He responded well and subsequently the dose of intravenous steroids was reduced and he was switched to oral Prednisone. A Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scan was performed that showed splenomegaly (15.7 cm) with multiple mass-like areas of increased uptake with a maximum SUV of 10.2. Patchy uptake was seen in the liver with a maximum SUV of 8.9 in the posterior right lobe. Multiple FDG-avid subdiaphragmatic, perigastric, peripancreatic, periportal, mesenteric, retroperitoneal, right iliac chain, and right external iliac lymph nodes were identified.
Following the diagnosis of THRLBCL, the patient was treated with R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin, Vincristine, and Prednisone) given the lack of data to support use of a more aggressive regimen such as DA-R-EPOCH (dose-adjusted Rituximab, Etoposide, Prednisone, Vincristine (Oncovin), Cyclophosphamide, and Doxorubicin). A PET scan performed after three cycles of chemotherapy showed a decrease in the size of the spleen (now 13.4 cm) with conversion to non-FDG-avid status. The multiple enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes also decreased in size and were no longer FDG-avid. The ferritin level decreased to 3304 ng/mL. The patient completed a total of six cycles of chemotherapy without complications at the end of which his ferritin was 822 ng/mL, LDH 170 U/L, and PET-CT scan showed no evidence of biologically active disease. The patient remains in remission after six months of completion of therapy.","

The abdominal and transvaginal US showed normal ovaries and a mass of 10 cm in diameter localized in the anterior zone of the uterus; the ultrasound pattern suggested the presence of a uterine fibromyoma that compressed the bladder wall. The urodynamic evaluation demonstrated the presence of bladder outlet obstruction (voiding pressure greater than 20 cm H2O and maximum flow rate less than 12 mL/s) with a postvoiding urine residual equal to 80 mL; moreover, the presence of cystocele and urethral stricture was ruled out by performing clinical evaluation, cystography and cystourethroscopy.
The patient underwent laparotomy to remove the uterine fibromyoma; a soft mass was found in the retropubic and prevesical space that was firmly adhered to the uterus with obliteration of vesicouterine pouch owing to severe adhesion to the anterior surface of uterus. The mass had a diameter of about 10 cm and rose from the space of Retzius; moreover, uterus, ovaries, and tubes were normal. The tumour was isolated, enucleated from the prevesical space, and removed (). The postoperative course was uneventful and the patient was discharged from hospital four days from surgery. Definitive histological specimen showed the presence of a leiomyoma; moreover, the women became free of symptoms 1 month from surgery.","

CR_ENG_318,English,"A 28-year-old male with Crohn's disease on azathioprine 100 mg daily in longstanding clinical remission presented to an outpatient gastroenterologist for sudden onset of right upper quadrant abdominal pain 8/10 in severity with radiation to his back. He also endorsed fevers but denied nausea, vomiting, any change in bowel movements, or rectal bleeding. Five months prior to admission, the patient had traveled to northern India and, while there, contracted “traveler's diarrhea,” which was self-limited and treated with loperamide.
At a gastroenterology clinic, a right upper quadrant ultrasound revealed a 46 mm hypoechoic lesion in the liver, correlating with the area of the patient's pain. The patient was then referred to the emergency room for further evaluation.
In the emergency room, the patient was afebrile without hypotension or tachycardia. Labs revealed a white blood cell count of 9.91 × 103/μL, hemoglobin of 13.4 g/dL, platelets of 277 × 103/μL, aspartate aminotransferase of 18 U/L, alanine aminotransferase of 22 U/L, total bilirubin of 0.5 mg/dL, alkaline phosphatase of 64 U/L, and C-reactive protein (CRP) of 23.2 mg/dL. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen/pelvis showed a 6.0 cm × 5.0 cm low/intermediate density lesion in segment 4A/B of the liver with a thick marginal rim and adjacent parenchymal inflammation and biliary prominence (). Due to concern for pyogenic abscess, the patient underwent drainage of the abscess by interventional radiology with 110 cc of reported “pus” removed “without anchovy appearance.” A drainage catheter was placed.
Following drainage, the patient was started on empiric ertapenem 1 g IV daily and metronidazole 500 mg PO TID. Azathioprine was held. Bacterial, fungal, and acid-fast cultures were negative from the drained fluid. Blood cultures were also negative, except one drawn 2 days into admission that resulted positive for Staphylococcus epidermidis, presumed to be a contaminant. Stool exam for ova and parasites resulted four days after admission with protozoa, later identified as Entamoeba coli trophozoites. The patient's second stool sample was positive for nonpathogenic protozoa, and the third stool sample was negative.
The patient was discharged on ciprofloxacin 750 mg PO BID and metronidazole 500 mg PO TID for an anticipated three-week antibiotic course from the day of drainage. Entamoeba histolytica IgG antibody returned positive three days after discharge, supporting the diagnosis of amebic liver abscess. The Entamoeba histolytica stool antigen returned negative. Echinococcus and Strongyloides serologies also returned negative. The drain was removed by interventional radiology 1 week after discharge. Repeat CT scan of the abdomen/pelvis 2 weeks after discharge revealed near complete resolution of the abscess with no drainable fluid collection ().","

CR_ENG_319,English,"A 58-year-old man (height 166 cm and weight 75 kg) was scheduled to undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy for symptomatic cholelithiasis. He was diagnosed with BMD at 12 years. He had difficulty in walking because of weakness in leg muscles. Pulmonary function tests revealed a forced vital capacity of 50% of the predicted levels and forced expiratory volume in 1 s of 92% of predicted levels. He had not experienced any episode of cardiac failure; his electrocardiogram was almost normal.
General anesthesia was induced with the effect site concentration at 4 μg/mL propofol using a target-controlled infusion (TCI) pump (Terufusion TE-371, Terumo, Tokyo, Japan), 0.2 mg fentanyl, and 0.25 μ/kg/min remifentanil. Rocuronium was not used. He was maintained on 2.5–3 μg/mL propofol with TCI and 0.1–0.15 μg/kg/min remifentanil with oxygen–air mixture. Anesthesia was maintained under TIVA without the use of muscle relaxants. After induction, images of the rectus abdominis muscle were monitored with LOGIQ e®(GE healthcare, Tokyo, Japan). Using a 20-G Tuohy needle (80 mm Hakko medical, Nagano, Japan), we performed ultrasound-guided bilateral RSB and right-sided subcostal TAPB with 0.75% ropivacaine 20 mL and 1% lidocaine 20 mL, for abdominal relaxation.
Mid-way through the surgery, the procedure required conversion to open surgery because of hard conglutination; however, non-depolarizing muscle relaxants were not required. As an analgesic, 1000 mg of acetaminophen was administered. After the completion of surgery, he was extubated and the patient did not feel any pain because of the wound.
For pain relief, flurbiprofen axetil 50 mg div was medicated after he was transferred to the surgical ward, after 8, and 16 h from the operation. Numerical Rating Scale regarding the wound pain changed 4~6 on the surgery day and 2~3 on postoperative day 1. Postoperative complication of bile leak afflicted him, but on postoperative day 93, the patient was discharged.","

CR_ENG_320,English,"A 32-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with the primary complaint of a persistent headache. Twenty-five days prior to admission, she experienced a headache after prolonged sitting; the headache involved a persistent, explosion-like pain in the bilateral temporal lobes and the top of head, which increased during walking and decreased or was absent when lying down, and was accompanied by nausea and vomiting. A lumbar puncture was performed 10 days after admission in order to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) pressure. Lumbar puncture results revealed that the CSF was light yellow in color and slightly cloudy, with a pressure of 60 mmH2O, leukocyte count of 10 × 106, and protein level of 600 mg/L (Table ). The patient was diagnosed with intracranial hypotension headache and was given fluid replacement and bed rest. Two days later, intracranial pressure was again measured via lumbar puncture and was found to be 95 mmH2O. At this point, the CSF was yellow in color and slightly cloudy, with a leukocyte count of 8 × 106, and protein level of 1000 mg/L. The headache symptoms resolved after 1 week of continuous treatment. However, 2 days later, the postural headache reappeared. The CSF pressure at this time was 30 mmH2O, with a cell count of 13 × 106 and protein level of 1862.2 mg/L (Table ).
Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) results indicated the presence of a subdural hematoma. The patient had no history of hypertension, diabetes, trauma, or surgery. Examination upon admission revealed the following results: her facial expression indicated pain, she was conscious, had normal-to-advanced intelligence, normal cranial nerve function, normal limb muscle strength, no bilateral pathological characteristics, and no meningeal irritation. The results of post-admission physical examinations [routine blood tests, electrolytes, kidney function, liver function, blood coagulation tests (four items), vascular inflammatory markers, immune function tests, etc.] were all normal. On the second day after admission, lumbar puncture revealed that the CSF was colorless and transparent, with an intracranial pressure of 35 mmH2O, a leukocyte count of 4 × 106, and a protein level of 1146 mg/L (Table ). Spinal MRI revealed no abnormalities.
On the sixth day after hospital admission, the patient underwent contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance myelography (CEMRM). The specific procedure was conducted as follows: after successful lumbar puncture, 10 mL of 5% gadoterate meglumine contrast agent was slowly injected into the spinal subarachnoid cavity at the intervertebral space between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae, following which 10 mL of saline was slowly injected into the same region. MR images (2D TSE Dixon T1) of the brain, thoracic neck region, and lumbar spine were obtained 15 min after contrast injection. The images indicated leakage of the contrast agent at the level of the third to sixth thoracic vertebrae (Figs. , ). The patient was diagnosed with spontaneous intracranial hypotension headache, according to the updated diagnostic criteria revised by Schievink et al. ().
On the patient’s seventh day of hospital admission, an epidural blood patch was performed at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra. An epidural injection was performed, and 15 mL of autologous blood was injected. The patient reported experiencing no discomfort after the procedure. After treatment, the patient was placed on 48 h of bed rest and experienced no headache when getting out of bed thereafter. Seven days after the epidural blood patch, the patient again underwent spinal angiography, which revealed no leakage of contrast agent (Figs. , ). The intracranial pressure was 90 mmH2O. The condition of the CSF was normal; it was colorless and transparent, with a leukocyte count of 6 × 106, and a protein level of 407 mg/L. The patient experienced complete remission of symptoms and was then discharged. Follow-up was conducted 1 month after discharge, by which time the patient had experienced no recurrence of symptoms.","

Endoscopy revealed a duodenal submucosal tumor. The patient was referred to our hospital for further investigation. He had a gastroduodenal ulcer and experienced occasional epigastric pain for the past 30 years. He received treatment for eradication of Helicobacter pylori at 43 years of age. Endoscopy at our hospital revealed stenosis of the duodenal bulb, which was suspected to be caused by a submucosal tumor and an active ulcer (Fig. A and B). In addition, bile excretion was only observed in a small opening near the ulcer (Fig. C). Abdominal computed tomography (CT) revealed normal findings in the duodenum, but gas in the bile ducts (pneumobilia). Contrast duodenography showed duodenal stenosis and reflux of the bile with a bile duct deformity (Fig. ). Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) showed severe angulation of the CBD (appearing as a hook-shaped configuration), which opened at a different site from the pancreatic duct (Fig. ). Endoscopic ultrasonography revealed hypoechoic lesion in the 2nd portion of the duodenum which was originating from the muscularis propria. It was difficult to distinguish inflammatory thickening from submucosal tumor. Endoscopic ultrasound fine-needle aspiration revealed inflammatory cells, and no evidence of neoplastic cells. Positron emission tomography CT showed [18F]-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) accumulation in the 2nd portion of the duodenum (standard uptake value—MAX: 4.15), but the delayed phase showed a decrease in accumulation. Based on these test results, a suspected diagnosis of groove pancreatitis was made, but with the findings of duodenal stenosis and hook-shaped CBD, the possibility of biliary neoplasm complicating choledochoduodenal fistula was also entertained. There was the possibility of malignancy; and surgical management was considered the rational treatment for the symptomatic groove pancreatitis, so we decided to perform pancreaticoduodenectomy. The patient’s complaints were relieved, and the laboratory data improved after surgery. The resected specimen revealed the papilla of Vater located in the 2nd portion of the duodenum, and the CBD opened approximately 2 cm proximal to the papilla of Vater (Fig. ). Histologically, the CBD opening had no sphincter muscles (Fig. A). The duodenum proximal to the opening of the CBD was stenotic due to ulceration and fibrosis. The CBD and pancreatic duct were separate openings with epithelial cells (Fig. A and B). These findings correlated with the diagnosis of EOCBD into the duodenal bulb.","

CR_ENG_325,English,"The patient was a 62-year-old female of African American ethnicity, with a past medical history of type 2 diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease secondary to diabetes, glaucoma, macrocytic anemia, chronic back pain and hypertension, who initially presented to her ophthalmologist with a small growth over her left upper eyelid. The patient had the swelling for more than four years that had gradually increased in size. She did not have it evaluated as it very occasionally caused symptoms like on and off tearing, itching, and irritation. She decided to seek medical care when she noticed some tenderness over the lesion. On initial evaluation, she was noted to have a 0.6 mm, elevated, cystic-appearing subcutaneous nodule in the central medial left upper lid margin and lash row. It was noninflamed and tender to palpation. The lesion was in close proximity to the cornea. All other eyelid and orbital functions were normal.
The lesion was initially thought to be a benign cyst. As it was symptomatic, it was excised and reconstruction was done. Histopathological analysis revealed positivity for carcinoma cells and suggested that it was a mucinous colloid carcinoma. As the margins were positive, a repeat excision with wider margins and reconstruction via advancement of her lateral full thickness upper lip into the central upper lid was done following a superior cantholysis of the lateral canthal tendon. The surgeons felt that there was no evidence of regional extension beyond what was excised. This was further confirmed by CT imaging of the orbits that revealed no locoregional extension or residual tumor (Figure ). Histopathological exam showed that the tumor was present within the dermis abutting the orbicularis muscle and was composed of lobules of epithelial cells floating in pools of mucin. Small ductal structures were observed within the lobules. A dual population of epithelial cells was identified with mild to moderate pleomorphism admixed with some atypical mitotic figures. Adjacent to the tumor, there were distended ductal structures with atypical proliferation of epithelial cells with a cribriform architecture and extracellular mucin. The tumor extended into the deep tissue edges, but perineural invasion was not identified. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the tumor was positive for tumor protein p63 (P63) and cytokeratin 7 (CK7) and negative for cytokeratin 20 (CK20), thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER-2). These findings confirmed the diagnosis of PMA of the eyelid.
Given that an underlying occult malignancy of the gastrointestinal tract or breast may present similarly, she was evaluated extensively with CT scans of the thorax, abdomen, and soft tissues of the neck. She also had a mammogram and a colonoscopy. All the tests were unremarkable and negative for malignancy. Given the rarity of the disease, Radiation Oncology and Medical Oncology services were integrated to her care. She is being followed up in regular intervals and has not had any recurrence of her tumor thus far.","

CR_ENG_326,English,"A 62-year-old Caucasian woman presented to the traumatology department with two small superficial wounds 2 × 2 mm after a bite from her dog, and without any signs of local infection (Additional file ). The wounds were disinfected and covered with a sterile dressing, and she was sent home.
The patient had undergone a splenectomy when she was 10 years old, but she had no knowledge of the indication for this surgical procedure. Since then, she had been healthy and had never been admitted to hospital. Thirty six hours after the dog bite, she became febrile, had muscle discomfort, and had general weakness. She presented to the emergency department where her blood pressure was 100/45 mmHg and, apart from C-reactive protein (CRP) 9 mg/L, all biochemical and hematological parameters were within normal limits. After application of crystalloid infusion, her condition improved and she was discharged home. Her symptoms were attributed to a viral infection.
However, after another 2 days she was admitted to the metabolic intensive care unit with a clinical picture of septic shock. She was tachypneic, febrile, and had acrocyanosis and decreased capillary return. Her blood pressure was 70/57 mmHg, and an electrocardiogram revealed sinus tachycardia of 105–115 beats/minute. Her CRP level was 237 mg/L, procalcitonin was 3.18 μg/L, white blood cells were 30.9 × 109/L, APACHE (Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation) score was 27, and SOFA (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment) score was 16 (Table ).
A peripheral three-ways central venous catheter (PICC) was introduced via the right brachial vein, and an arterial cannula placed in the right radial artery. PICC was selected because of abnormal coagulation. The hemodynamic response to volume expansion was insufficient, and the application of catecholamine support was necessary. Noradrenalin was given at a dose of 50 μg/min and gradually increased up to 66 μg/min in order to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure above 65 mmHg. The patient also presented with acute respiratory failure with arterial desaturation, carbon dioxide retention, and respiratory acidosis. She was sedated, intubated and put on artificial respiratory support. A high fraction of oxygen (80%) and positive expiratory pressure were necessary for efficient ventilation. Comparison of chest X-rays in the emergency room and another after admission demonstrated the speed of evolution of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (Additional file ). One week later a tracheostomy was carried out. Routine practice was implemented to prevent aspiration (30–45 degree head of bed elevation, regular subglottic suctioning, comprehensive oral care with antiseptic solution, etc.).
An empiric combination of broad-spectrum antibiotics (piperacilinum tazobactam + ciprofloxacin) was given as soon as blood samples were drawn for microbiological examination. Many units of fresh frozen plasma were given because the patient presented with disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and severe thrombocytopenia (24 × 109/L) accompanied by petechiae (Additional file ).
The patient developed acute kidney failure grade F according to the RIFLE (Risk, Injury, Failure, Loss of kidney function, and End-stage kidney disease) classification. As the hemodynamic situation of the patient was compromised, continuous venovenous hemodialysis (CVVHD) was selected for renal replacement therapy, and applied on the second day of admission in the intensive metabolic care unit. A hemodialysis catheter was inserted into the right femoral vein. Nutrition was provided by early enteral nutrition through a nasojejunal tube.
On the 5th day of admission, blood culture revealed massive infection with Gram-negative bacteria identified as Capnocytophaga canimorsus, which was resistant only to cotrimoxazol. According to the minimum inhibitory concentration, clindamycin 600 mg every 6 hours was added to the antibiotic regimen.
The clinical condition of the patient gradually stabilized. Noradrenaline application was stopped on the 9th day of admission and CVVHD was changed to intermittent hemodialysis on the 13th day of admission. Renal function steadily improved. Her fever resolved, and her vital functions improved, allowing her to be weaned from ventilation support. She was able to breathe spontaneously with peak end expiratory pressure 5 mmHg. Sedation was reduced and she communicated with nursing staff. Her CRP decreased to 30 mg/L, procalcitonin to 0.64 μg/L, white blood cells to 11.1 × 109/L, platelet count normalized to 200 × 109/L, and her chest X-ray was normal.
However, before we could remove the tracheal tube the patient’s condition suddenly worsened, with a deterioration in respiratory function. She developed a fever, her CRP increased to 180 mg/L, procalcitonin to 2.54 μg/L and white blood cells to 22 × 109/L. Clinical examination and a chest X-ray revealed a huge bilateral fluidothorax due to pleuropneumonia on both sides. Both pleural cavities were punctured and drained for a few following weeks. The daily output of pleural effusion reached 2–2.5 L. According to Light criteria, exudates on both sides had high protein and lactate dehydrogenase concentrations. Microscopic examination identified Gram-negative acid-resistant bacteria, but exudate cultivation was recurrently negative. She was empirically given another antibiotic (Figure ).
Finally, bronchoscopy was performed and bronchoalveolar lavage microbiological examination revealed Enterococcus faecium at a concentration of 105, which was sensitive to vancomycin, and Candida albicans at a concentration of 107, which was sensitive to fluconazole. In the 2–3 weeks following vancomycin and fluconazole application, the patient gradually improved but pleural suction was necessary until the 60th day of admission. However, removal of the tracheal cannula was possible 10 days earlier.
The patient was successfully rehabilitated in the general ward and 103 days after admission, she was discharged home in good condition.
The described patient was one of the most susceptible individuals to Capnocytophaga canimorsus sepsis because she had a splenectomy. The spleen has a crucial role in prevention of bacterial infection because of production of IgM by B-lymphocytes and complement, and tuftsin activation participating in opsonization of Gram-negative bacilli []. The clinical picture of fully evolved sepsis by Capnocytophaga canimorsus appeared within 3–4 days as described in previously reported cases [,,]. The course of disease was complicated by multiorgan failure – septic shock, ARDS, acute kidney failure, and disseminated coagulation. Fortunately, the patient improved after early empiric antibiotic treatment and vigorous support for vital functions, including artificial ventilation and CVVHD, and after 2 weeks we started weaning her from assisted ventilation.
However, 3 weeks after admission the patient again deteriorated and developed bilateral pleuropneumonia. A nosocomial infection was immediately suspected, and her antibiotic treatment was modified according to consultation with the hospital microbiology laboratory. This time Capnocytophaga canimorsus was no longer present but Enterococcus faecium and Candida albicans were revealed by bronchoalveolar lavage culture.","

CR_ENG_327,English,"We are reporting about the case of a 22-year old woman, who made a first visit as an outpatient with pain that arose in acute form in the area of the left groin. The complaints occurred in acute form without preceding trauma and led to inability to put stress on the left leg. Until the occurrence of this acute pain the patient was free of complaints and active in sports.
The physical examination produced pain on pressure in the groin as well as pronounced pain on movement of the left hip joint mainly during inner rotation. There were no neurological deficits. Soft tissue, blood circulation and sensorimotor function of the lower extremities were intact. Similarly there were no signs of an acute infection or general disease symptoms such as fever, night sweat or loss of weight. The ultrasound of the inguinal region carried out subsequently revealed an intraarticular exudate of the left hip joint, so that conventional X-ray examination was initiated.
In the overview of the pelvis and of the axial image of the left hip joint an osteolytic lesion appeared in the area of the proximal femur with partially compartmented portions and reactive peripheral sclerosis. In addition a pathological fracture was remarkable in the area of the calcar, which explained the complaints of the patient. (Fig. )
An MRI of the pelvis produced a large, cystic space occupying lesion of the neck of thigh [collum femoris] and proximal femur without sign of malignant degeneration. (Fig. )
The blood test showed an increase of the alkaline phosphatase to 115 U/l (reference value: 35–104 U/l) otherwise with parameters of normal value.
Relying on differential diagnosis an aneurismal bone cyst, giant cell tumor and juvenile bone cyst were discussed.
Owing to the pathological fracture, finally the indication of operation seemed sensible and it was carried out by bone biopsy, curettage, spongiose plastic surgery and internal fixation (DHS). (Fig. )
Postoperatively the histological examination of the bone material taken intraoperatively made the diagnosis of fibrous dysplasia, which was not taken into consideration in the preoperative considerations during differential diagnosis.
For the assessment of the distribution pattern in conclusion bone scintigraphy was still performed, according to which a monoostotic form of fibrous dysplasia affected the patient.","

CR_ENG_328,English,"This is a 5-year-old Saudi girl who presented with generalized weakness, easy fatigability, pallor, and poor oral intake, O2 saturation 97%, and the patient was hemodynamically stable. She was admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at birth when her first blood count showed hemoglobin (Hb) of 4 gm/dL for which she received a blood transfusion. Initial investigation included a normal flow cytometry, that ruled out malignancy or immunologic disorders, and molecular genetics that confirmed a diagnosis of α-thalassemia trait which had no clinical implications. Further investigations were planned but the patient was lost to follow-up. For 5 years till the current presentation, the child did not follow up at any medical center, and the parents clarified that the child had a normal life with no reported manifestations of medical concern. Both parents are consanguineous with no medical history of concern. She had no history of recurrent infection, no history of blood transfusions, hypertension, diabetes, or other conditions of medical concerns, no history of previous surgeries, and no history of drug allergies. Developmental history was compatible with her age and vaccination was up to date. On examination, she looked pale, fatigued, and not dysmorphic; cardiac examination showed a hemic systolic murmur at the apex; there was no organomegaly, no dermatologic manifestations, no signs of skin inflammation or vasculitis; and neurologic examination and other systems review were unremarkable. Subsequently, she was admitted to the hospital for further investigation and supportive treatment. Her initial blood works showed Hb of 3.8 gm/dL, reticulocytopenia, slightly elevated serum bilirubin, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. She had a positive direct antiglobulin test (DAT++) and was given packed red blood cells (PRBCs) with good improvement (). The initial impression was autoimmune hemolytic anemia with reticulocytopenia, so the child started on trials of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 1 gm/kg/day for 2 days and prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day for 1 month and tapering over 2 weeks with no apparent response. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy were performed and showed reduced erythropoiesis that is consistent with PRCA. Parvovirus and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were not detected. The patient was kept under close follow-up at the clinic while preparing for the bone marrow transplantation process. She has a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched sibling donor. Meanwhile, whole exome sequencing (WES) was requested aiming at a final solid diagnosis. During that time, the patient required weekly blood transfusion, as the HB level was dropping so fast reaching down to 2 gm/dL in some reports. Sequence analysis using the Blueprint Genetics (BpG) Whole Exome Plus identified CECR1 c.714_738dup, p. (Ala247Glnfs*16) a homozygous variant and a heterozygous missense variant G6PD c.563C>T, p. (Ser188Ph). Following the diagnosis, we aimed to start the patient on anti-tumor necrosis factor agents; however, the parents refused this type of therapy, so we are currently preparing the patient for bone marrow transplantation; she is clinically well, with reduced blood transfusion requirements (every 3-4 weeks).","

CR_ENG_330,English,"A 51-year-old woman ingested cibenzoline succinate (6,900 mg) with alcohol during a suicide attempt. Approximately 75 min after ingestion, she was brought to our emergency department. Physical examination at arrival revealed the following: respiratory rate, 17 breaths/min; pulse rate, 20–30 b.p.m.; blood pressure, 84/50 mmHg; tympanic temperature, 35.5°C; and Glasgow Coma Scale score, 7 (E1V1M5). Her electrocardiogram showed a wide QRS (0.36 ms). Blood examination revealed mild liver dysfunction.
Echocardiography revealed dyssynchrony in left ventricle wall motion, with 30% left ventricular ejection fraction. Considering her worsening clinical condition, including hypotension and bradycardia, she was intubated and placed on mechanical ventilation. Treatment with noradrenaline (0.2 μg/kg/min) and transcutaneous pacing were ineffective.
Approximately 26 min after admission, her electrocardiogram indicated ventricular fibrillation (VF). Twenty minutes later, venoarterial extracorporeal membranous oxygenation (V-A ECMO) treatment was started for cardiac arrest with VF. She developed alternating bradycardia and VF during V-A ECMO. Changes in plasma her cibenzoline succinate levels were observed during treatment (Fig. ).
Plasma exchange was carried out for 2 h using Plasmaflo (Asahi Kasei Medical, Tokyo, Japan) at quantity of blood flow rate of 100 mL/min and quantity of plasma flow rate of 25 mL/min to reduce her plasma cibenzoline succinate concentration; however, her hemodynamics did not improve. Continuous hemofiltration (CHF) was undertaken to treat acute kidney injury with anuria using AEF (Asahi Kasei Medical) at quantity of blood flow rate of 180 mL/min and quantity of filtration rate of 2000 mL/h.
Due to continuous arrhythmias and lack of improvement in her hemodynamics, approximately 15 h after cibenzoline ingestion, DHP was carried out using Hemosorba CHS-350, which included an activated charcoal-coated hemoperfusion column (Asahi Kasei Medical). After DHP, her electrocardiogram showed a change from a wide QRS to a narrow QRS, hemodynamics improved, and she no longer had anuria; therefore, CHF and DHP were terminated after 4.5 h. However, 40 min after withdrawal, her electrocardiogram showed a wide QRS and ventricular tachycardia, indicating clinical deterioration.
Her clinical condition immediately improved following a second DHP, and her electrocardiogram showed a sinus rhythm within a normal QRS range (Fig. ). We decided there was no need to resume CHF, because her renal function had been gradually improving. On day 3, her hemodynamics stabilized and the left ventricular dyssynchrony disappeared. Hence, we decided to withdraw DHP; her hemodynamics were monitored carefully for a few hours, after which ECMO was safely withdrawn. On day 5, mechanical ventilation was successfully withdrawn. On day 9, she was transferred to another hospital for treatment of her psychological disorder, without arrhythmia recurrence.","

CR_ENG_331,English,"A 46-year-old man with a family history of premature coronary artery disease, dyslipidemia and two previous angioplasties for restenosis of a bifurcation lesion of a dominant left circumflex coronary artery (LCx), was admitted because of new onset effort angina 4 months post his last angioplasty. The new coronary angiogram that was performed demonstrated restenosis proximal to and at the bifurcation site of the LCx (Fig. , Video), a known chronic occlusion of a small right coronary artery and good systolic left ventricular function with no segmental abnormalities.
An angioplasty was performed with an EBU 3.5 6F guiding catheter (Launcher, Medtronic, MA, USA) by kissing balloon inflations with a 3/20-mm balloon (Artimes, BrosMed, KM, Netherlands) in the continuation of the LCx and a 3.5/20-mm balloon (Maverick, Boston Scientific, MA, USA) in the main vessel, over two cougar XT guide wires (Medtronic, MA, USA). A 3.5/9-mm stent (Resolute Integrity, Medtronic, MA, USA) was deployed just proximal to the bifurcation followed by sequential and kissing balloon inflations with the previously used balloon catheters at the bifurcation site.
An additional inflation was deemed necessary and the previously used 3/20 balloon (Artimes, BrosMed) was prepared again by applying negative pressure and was inserted and advanced to the LCx for the third time. The plunger of the indeflator was advanced, but the balloon was not visualized and the first thought was that the balloon was not well prepared and was inflated with air or saline. A small test injection was not informative and was followed by ST segment elevation noticed on the ECG monitor while the patient started complaining of precordial chest pain. On a second injection, the angiographic picture was that of complete occlusion of the proximal left anterior descending artery and the proximal dominant LCx with no distal vessel visualization. The first impression was that of massive air embolism, but the injection of thrombotic material was also a possibility (Fig. , Video). There was a moment of uncertainty as to the source of such a large amount of air distributed to the whole left coronary artery while the balloon was located at the distal part of the LCx.
The patient collapsed with electromechanical dissociation. We administered 1 mg of adrenaline and 1 mg of atropine intracoronary followed by forceful injections of warm saline. The patient was ventilated at 100% oxygen with a mask. The period of circulatory collapse lasted less than 3 min and then suddenly the pressure jumped to 240/160 mmHg and the heart rate to 150 beats per minute (bpm). About 10 min later, the arterial blood pressure was 70/50 mmHg, the heart rate 110 bpm, and the patient required intravenous dopamine for hemodynamic support. The final angiographic evaluation showed a satisfactory angiographic result with TIMI-3 flow in the whole left coronary artery (Fig. , Video). An echocardiographic evaluation demonstrated good left ventricular function with no segmental abnormalities.
Inspection of the balloon catheter under water demonstrated that the air was escaping during inflation of the balloon at the transition bonding joint, where the wire shaft meets the hard shaft of the catheter (Video).
Post-procedurally, there was a mild increase of the cardiac enzymes and the ECG showed negative T waves in leads V1–V6, which 12 h later reverted to positive. The patient required intravenous dopamine infusion for several hours due to persistent low blood pressure, despite the good left ventricular function. He was discharged 2 days later in hemodynamically stable condition.","

CR_ENG_335,English,"An 11-year-old girl was referred by the operating surgeon for the management of ‘simple congenital ptosis surgery overcorrection’. There was negative family history of ptosis and past history was remarkable only for levator resection surgery performed by a general facial plastic surgeon 2 months prior to presentation in Gaza. On examination both eyes were partially amblyopic with a visual acuity of 20/25 (OD) and 20/70 (OS). Both eyes were fixed in an infraducted position (20 Δ) and were immobile vertically but had limited motility horizontally with a peculiar chin-up position despite the retracted eyelids []. The patient neither displayed a Marcus Gunn jaw winking phenomena nor any synkinetic movements on attempted elevation. No preoperative pictures were available to evaluate the ptosis but the parents maintained that she always had severe bilateral congenital ptosis. Vertical palpebral fissure height was 20 mm (OS) and 18 mm (OD). The eyelid contour was excellent but she had mild lash ptosis in the medial half of the right upper eyelid. When instructed to forcefully close the eyelids, she had 8 mm of lagophthalmos with significant corneal exposure, and an absent Bell's phenomena, but curiously there was no evidence of corneal affection. A Schirmer 1 test (5 minutes without anesthesia) was performed, and the result was 10 mm wetting (OD), and 9 mm (OS). She was classified as a simplex case of CFEOM type I because of negative family history and the typical clinical picture.
The patient underwent a single-stage adjustable bilateral 12-mm inferior rectus recession under general anesthesia. All adhesions and fibrous bands were released. Forced duction testing performed at the beginning of the procedure showed both eyes were completely immobile vertically. At the conclusion of the procedure, a forced duction test demonstrated that upwards motility was improved. To safeguard against lower eyelid retraction the lower eyelid was left on forehead traction for 48 hours. One week after surgery, the patient was orthophoric in the primary position with a residual 1 mm of upper eyelid retraction, significant reduction of lagophthalmos, and partial recovery of Bell's phenomena []. Neither eye required further adjustment.
Because of the acceptable final cosmetic outcome, the parents declined further eyelid lowering although they were informed of the persistent risk of corneal exposure because lagophthalmos was reduced but not completely relieved. Two years after surgery the patient remains orthophoric with no evidence of corneal exposure.","

CR_ENG_338,English,"In August 2015, a 61-year-old White female presented to her primary care provider with concerns regarding a 12-lb weight loss in the past 3 months. Given the patient's social history of 40-pack-year smoking and the patient's family history of lung cancer, a lung cancer screening CT was performed. The CT showed a 3.2 cm × 4.1 cm posterior left upper lobe (LUL) pulmonary mass with extension to the pleural margin as well as a 7 mm right middle lobe (RML) nodule. Subsequently, diagnostic bronchoscopy with LUL and RML video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) wedge resection and left and right mediastinal lymph node dissection was conducted. In addition, VATS LUL completion lobectomy was conducted. Histologic examination revealed a Stage IB LUL adenocarcinoma [] and a stage IA RML squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) []. From 2016 to 2019, several follow-up CTs were conducted to monitor for possible recurrence. Early follow-up CTs indicated changes that were consistent with expected postsurgical findings. No new pathologically enlarged mediastinal lymph nodes or evidence of metastasis in the chest, abdomen, or pelvis were detected. However, in January 2020, CT findings demonstrated a noticeable interval increase in the size of the subcarinal lymph node and right lymph node conglomerate encasing the RUL pulmonary artery concerning for local metastasis (a).
The patient now presents at our institution for a follow-up on her NSCLC following the concerning CT scan. She presents with dyspnea and cough secondary to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but denies worsening shortness of breath and hemoptysis. The patient continues to smoke daily. Physical examination of the respiratory system demonstrates scattered rhonchi and expiratory wheezing bilaterally without rales or labored respiration. Overall impression suggests pulmonary findings consistent with COPD with imaging concerning for carcinoma recurrence and metastasis. Pulmonology specialists met with the patient and ascertained a history and physical examination consistent with that previously indicated. The CT findings and the need for a lung biopsy to confirm for metastasis were discussed with the patient. Endobronchial ultrasound bronchoscopy was used to sample the mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes. Histological examination revealed clustered cells with nuclear molding, inconspicuous nuclei, and crush artifact. Immunohistochemical findings revealed thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)-positive, synaptophysin-positive, and P40-negative malignant cells (b and c). The overall findings confirm the diagnosis of small cell carcinoma []. The patient was placed on cisplatin/etoposide combination therapy tentatively.

CR_ENG_339,English,"A 76-year-old female with past medical history of well-controlled hypertension, coronary artery disease presented with subacute progressive shortness of breath for two weeks. On presentation, blood pressure (BP) was 238/146 mm Hg, heart rate (HR) of 75 beats per minute (bpm), SaO2 (oxygen saturation) to 80% and was placed on 4 L nasal cannula (NC) with improvement in her oxygenation. Physical exam was remarkable for pulsus paradoxus, distant heart sounds without murmurs or gallops, marked jugular venous distension, diminished breath sounds at the bases and mild bilateral lower extremity pitting edema. Electrocardiogram (EKG) showed only low voltage (Figure ).
Chest radiograph showed enlarged cardiac silhouette and bilateral moderate pleural effusions. An echocardiogram demonstrated moderate to large pericardial effusion with tamponade physiology (Figures , , ).
The patient remained significantly hypertensive despite adding three antihypertensive medications requiring labetalol drip with failure to control her blood pressure. She underwent pericardiocentesis with the removal of 1200 cc bloody fluid. Right heart catheterization was also done prior and after the pericardiocentesis, which indicated severely elevated right-sided pressures and equalization of right atrial, right ventricular and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure with diminished cardiac output. There was a significant improvement in right-sided pressures following pericardial drainage, with a mean right atrial pressure of 10 mm Hg down from 21 mm Hg. Systemic blood pressure normalized after pericardiocentesis. Follow-up echocardiogram showed resolution of the pericardial effusion. Further workup was done to identify the etiology of the pericardial effusion, including fluid cytology, culture, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), serum antinuclear antibodies (ANA), serum complement, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C-reactive protein (CRP), anti-double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), and anti-Smith antibody.

CR_ENG_341,English,"A 15-year-old Thai male who had recurrent T-cell lymphoma. He was diagnosed with the disease 3 years earlier, and treated with 6 cycles of chemotherapy. Regular follow-ups showed no signs of recurrence until 1 week before admission when he developed progressive dyspnoea. Chest X-ray at a provincial hospital showed massive right lung pleural effusion and an anterior mediastinal mass was detected. His GP referred him to a tertiary level hospital for further care. Upon admission, hospital regulations stated that a patient who is over 15 years of age must be admitted to an adult ward; hence he was transferred to an internal medicine ward. During his first night, he witnessed the death of a patient who had a cardiac arrest. The nightshift team performed CPR, intubation, and various other lifesaving procedures. The boy witnessed all of this, and was deeply traumatised. After which, he had a complete psychotic breakdown and did not stop screaming until his doctor sedated him. When he woke up in the night, he continued screaming; thus he needed to be sedated again, and nurses had to put a curtain around his bed, blocking him off from the rest of the ward. At the time of his palliative care team consultation, the patient was restless with a palliative performance scale (PPS) of 40, and had suicidal tendencies. He kept screaming whenever he woke up, calling constantly for his mother to end his misery and yelling, “I don’t belong in this place”. Further history taking revealed that he had every aspect of total pain: physical, emotional, social, and spiritual.
His pain was dull and occurred mainly around the chest area, without any radiation. His baseline pain score was 9 out of 10 while the worst pain was 10 out of 10. He also complained of dyspnoea which worsened when he talked a lot or felt anxious.
A psychiatrist assessed him and diagnosed him with adjustment disorder from both his progressive illness and the traumatising experience of witnessing his first death.
The patient had a high-achiever profile. He was the top of his class, played basketball at the regional level, and was loved by everyone. He constantly talked about his fear of being “left out” of his group of friends because he could not attend school anymore, and that they were moving forward while he was “stuck here”. His mother is a palliative care nurse and was torn between her role as a nurse and the mother of a dying child. She felt unsure about the advance care plan (ACP), and whether she should make the decisions for her son or let him decide for himself. His father and sister also concurred.
Spirituality is described as an individual’s search for meaning and purpose in life, the experience of the transcendent, and also one’s connectedness with others: his or herself, nature, and to the sacred realms, inside as well as outside of traditional religion []. In the patient’s case, his sources of strength were his family, academic interests, especially in English, and his friends. He had an existential crisis and felt that his life was meaningless because he was no longer who he had once been, “I am alone in a world full of dying old men”. He felt it would be better for his misery to end than to keep existing with no meaning. He constantly asked his mother when would he die and would he end up like that man he saw in the ward.
For his physical pain, we used the WHO analgesic ladder to slowly titrate his medications with morphine and other adjuvants. Along with solving his other pain components together, his pain and dyspnoea were well-controlled with subcutaneous morphine and fentanyl patch 3 days after the consultation. As for his psychological pain, to prevent him from further psychic trauma, we moved him to a private room in a paediatric ward, where the environment was more familiar to him. He seemed a lot more at ease there. We also prescribed lorazepam, haloperidol, and subcutaneous midazolam for his anxiety. For his social and spiritual pain, the team contacted his teachers and friends, all of whom were worried sick about him. A few days later, his teachers, classmates, and underclassmen paid him a visit. They made get-well cards for him and performed Bai Sri Su Kwan: a Thai blessing ceremony that celebrates important events or conveys wishes for an individual’s well-being. His friends brought him learning materials and homework and kept contact with him via social media so that he would not feel left out again. They also made it clear that he was still part of their group, as always. One nurse on our team also offered to teach him English, provided that he was not too exhausted.
For his ACP, after the family meeting, everyone in his family agreed that the patient was very mature for a boy his age and they agreed that it would be in his best interest to let him decide the goal of care by himself. After the full explanation of the prognosis, he chose to be cared at home, alongside his friends and family. The team then prepared the essential medications, made a comprehensive referral note, and contacted the district hospital beforehand so that when he arrived home there would be a community nurse regularly checking up on his symptoms and refilling his subcutaneous medications. He passed away comfortably a few days after he was discharged, in his bedroom, with his best friend and mother by his side.","

CR_ENG_342,English,"A 24-year-old Asian woman first presented with a 6-week history of being generally unwell with a flu-like illness, low-grade continuous fever, anorexia and enlarged cervical lymph nodes. She had also lost weight, but there was no history of arthralgia or night sweats. There was no history of tuberculosis. She was born in the UK and visited Bangladesh 2 years earlier. She was fit and a non-smoker, with no significant past medical or family history. The patient was on no medication. Examination revealed a mobile, non-tender group of lymph nodes measuring 2 × 2 cm in the sub-mental region of the cervical group. The remainder of the clinical examination was unremarkable. Laboratory tests revealed haemoglobin of 9.5 × 109/l, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) 116 mm/h with a normal white cell count and peripheral blood film. Renal function and liver function tests were normal and there was no proteinuria. Serum immunoglobulins IgA, IgG and IgM were all elevated. Immunology was all normal, including assays for rheumatoid factor, immunofluorescence (IF) for anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCA), anti-nuclear antibodies (ANA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies (anti-ds DNA). Complement C3 and C4 were also normal. Blood cultures showed no growth. Hepatitis, toxoplasma and Epstein-Barr virus serology were negative. Ultrasound of the abdomen and chest x-ray were normal. In view of her ethnic background, symptoms and lymphadenopathy, she was also investigated for the presence of tuberculosis. Sputum was negative for acid-fast bacilli (AFB). Bronchial washings were also negative for AFB, both in stain and in culture. A diagnostic lymph node biopsy was performed. Histopathology of the specimen revealed necrotizing histiocytic lymphadenitis consistent with the diagnosis of KD. The patient was commenced on a trial of prednisolone with good response and the steroids were tapered after 3 months. The fever disappeared, as did the lymph node swelling and the patient made an uneventful recovery.
Two years later, she presented again, this time with Raynaud's syndrome of both hands. Examination was unremarkable except for bluish discoloration of the fingers of both hands and fingertip ulceration. Urine analysis revealed 4+ protein and 2+ blood with a proteinuria of 7 g/day. The creatinine clearance was normal. C3 and C4 were all low. Immunofluorescence for ANA was positive with a titre of 1:1024 and a speckled pattern. Anti-ds DNA ELISA was positive at 84 U/ml. Assays for anti-RNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro and anti-La were all positive. A diagnosis of probable SLE was made, and she was started on prednisolone 60 mg/day whilst awaiting a kidney biopsy. The kidney biopsy showed membranous glomerulonephritis in keeping with type V lupus nephritis (Figures –). She was started on mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). Her most recent urine protein creatinine ratio is 230 g/mol with normal renal function while on MMF and prednisolone. There were no extra-renal symptoms of SLE and her Raynaud's had improved as well, without recent digital infarcts.","

La radiographie de l’abdomen sans préparation n’a pas été réalisée à cause de la grossesse; l’échographie abdominale et l’IRM n’étaient pas disponibles en urgence dans notre hôpital. Le bilan biologique montrait: une hyperleucocytose à 19, 2 106 /L avec une polynucléose neutrophile à 17, 66 106/L, une insuffisance rénale (clearance de la créatinine à 57, 5 ml/min), une hypernatrémie à 146 meq/L et une hypokaliémie à 2, 8 meq/L. Le taux de Prothrombine était normal à 72%. Les enzymes pancréatiques n’avaient pas été dosées en pré-opératoire. Le diagnostic d’occlusion intestinale aigüe fébrile sur grossesse a été retenu et l’indication d’une laparotomie exploratrice posée. A la laparotomie, on a découvert sur le grand omentum, le mésentère et le mésocolon transverse des tâches de cytostéatonécrose évocatrices de la pancréatite aiguë nécrotique. La graisse du mésocolon transverse et du ligament gastrocolique étaient infiltrées. La vésicule biliaire était alithiasique et les voies biliaires fines. L’utérus était globuleux et portait des taches de cytostéatonécrose. On a évoqué une pancréatite aiguë nécrotique. Un bilan biologique prélevé en post opératoire à révélé une hyper amylasémie à 264 UI/l (3.1 fois la limite supérieure de la normale), une hypernatrémie à 146 meq/L, une hypokaliémie à 2, 8 meq/l. La lipasémie n’avait pas été dosée car non disponible dans notre hôpital. La prise en charge a associé le repos digestif, la correction des troubles hydro-électrolytiques, les antalgiques, l’antibiothérapie (ceftriaxone + métronidazole) et la tocolyse. L’évolution était marquée au 4ème jour post-opératoire par l’altération de la conscience avec un score de Glasgow à 11/15 (E4V2M5) et l’aggravation des troubles ioniques; la lipasémie alors dosée dans un laboratoire en ville était normale à 32 UI/L. Au 6ème jour post opératoire, elle expulsa son fœtus vivant dont le décès était survenu 6 heures après. Au 8ème jour post opératoire, elle est décédée dans un contexte de choc septique et de troubles hydro-électrolytiques.","

CR_FRE_2,French,"Les auteurs rapportent le cas d'un traumatisme ouvert de la cheville gauche avec luxation tibiotalienne complète, référé pour amputation. Madame I.L.F., est une étudiante âgée de 25 ans, référée par un chirurgien de l'Hôpital Régional d'Edéa (HRE) à l'Hôpital Laquintinie de Douala (HLD) pour une luxation ouverte grave de la cheville gauche, après qu'elle ait refusé l'amputation qui lui a été proposée.
Elle était passagère d'une moto qui est entré en collision à Edéa sur l'axe lourd Douala-Yaoundé, avec une voiture roulant à vive allure, le 17 Septembre 2011 à 13H. Il s'ensuit un choc direct sur sa cheville gauche et une chute du même côté. Elle n'a pas perdu connaissance, a une large plaie et une importante déformation de sa cheville gauche associée à une impotence fonctionnelle immédiate. Les témoins l'amènent de toute urgence à l'HRE où un pansement compressif, un garrot, des antibiotiques antalgiques et du sérum antitétanique sont faits et un géloplasma perfusé avant sa référence à l'HLD. A l'admission, l'état général est moyen, la pression artérielle à 130/60mmHg, le pouls à 80 pulsations/minute, la fréquence respiratoire à 22 cycles par minute et le score de Glasgow à 15/15.
Localement, on note le garrot, le pansement compressif et une légère mobilité distale. La sensibilité plantaire est présente. Après avoir défait le garrot qui a duré une heure 10minutes, le pouls pédieux est absent mais le pouls tibial postérieur est présent mais faible. La cheville est très déformée. La radiographie montre une luxation tibio-talienne avec perte de contact total entre la mortaise tibiofibulaire et la poulie astragalienne et sans fracture .
Elle est opérée quatre heures après son traumatisme, sous anesthésie générale avec intubation orotrachéale. L'exploration montre une plaie articulaire de 10 cm de large, et 30 cm de long remontant vers la jambe, exposant le tibia, le péroné, la cheville, et des tendons fléchisseurs sectionnés de même que l'artère tibiale antérieure et les 2 veines saphènes. L'artère tibiale postérieure et ses deux veines satellites sont conservées avec un bon pouls après la réduction. Les deux branches terminales du nerf sciatique poplité externe que sont le musculocutané et le tibial antérieur sont également lésés. Le nerf tibial postérieur, branche terminale du nerf sciatique poplité interne est conservé. La syndesmose tibiofibulaire est conservée. La capsule articulaire est désinsérée du squelette jambier, de même que les ligaments latéraux. La peau est dévitalisée et rabattue en médial. Le score de prédiction MESS (Mangled Extremity Severity Score) est estimé à 5 et nous décidons de ne pas amputer. Nous réalisons un débridement, un lavage au salé, une réduction, un enclouage transplantaire à l'aide d'une broche de Steinman, une capsuloraphie, une réparation nerveuse, une ligamentoplastie, un rapprochement de la peau, des incisions de décharge, un pansement et une attèle plâtrée postérieure anti-équin.
Les suites opératoires sont simples. Le pouls tibial postérieur reste bien perceptible et la coloration du pied normale malgré l'oedème. La radiographie de contrôle postopératoire est satisfaisante . Les soins locaux sont néanmoins prolongés, car il ya eu nécrose de la peau dévitalisée. L'ablation de la broche transplantaire a été faite à la huitième semaine. La greffe de peau prévue n'a pas été faite et la cicatrisation dirigée est obtenue au quatrième mois postopératoire . La patiente marche après des séances de kinésithérapie, avec deux cannes et sans douleurs, au quatrième mois postopératoire.","

CR_FRE_3,French,"Patient G.M, âgé de 55 ans, sans antécédent pathologique notable. Admis aux urgences pour douleurs abdominales au niveau de l'hypochondre, et du flanc droit, associées à une fièvre à 38, 5°C. L'examen clinique trouvait une légère défense abdominale épigastrique. Le taux des globules blancs était de 18000/mm3. Le scanner abdominal a mis en évidence une masse hypodense, hétérogène, de contours irréguliers, à paroi épaissie, avec une infiltration inflammatoire et de l'aire à l'intérieur, mesurant 5 cm de diamètre du grand axe . Cette masse semblait être au dépend du 3ème duodénum. Il n'y avait pas de pneumo ni de retropneumopéritoine ni d’épanchement intra abdominal. L'IRM a confirmé les données du scanner en montrant une structure hétérogène de contours irrégulier, hyposignal en T1, et hypersignal en T2. Les structures vasculaires étaient épargnées, l'uretère droit passait juste à côté sans qu'il soit pris par la masse. La fibroscopie oesogastroduodénale (FOGD) n'a pas montré de lésion à part une muqueuse duodénale légèrement érythémateuse. Le transit du grêle (TG) a objectivé un aspect d’écartement des anses intestinales par le diverticule sans signe d'extravasation extradigestive . En absence d'une réponse favorable au traitement médical associant l'antibiothérapie (Amoxicilline, acide clavulanique, amikacine, métronidazole) et l'alimentation parentérale, le patient fut opéré, l'exploration chirurgicale a objectivé la présence d'un diverticule abcédé, se développait sur le bord externe du genu inferius. La mobilisation du bloc duodénopancréatique était délicate à cause du processus inflammatoire, la dissection du diverticule était menée de façon très prudente après repérage des structures vasculaires. On a opté pour une résection diverticulaire avec suture en 2 plans du pertuis duodénal . Les suites étaient marquées par une fistule digestive à gros débit qui a nécessité une reprise chirurgicale à j + 5. Une exclusion duodénale a été réalisée. L’évolution était favorable. L'examen de contrôle après un mois était sans particularité.","

Les suites opératoires étaient simples. Elle est adressée actuellement dans notre structure pour prise en charge d’une insuffisance rénale aigue associée à une hématurie macroscopique d’abondance minime et d’une issue de collection par le trajet pariétal de néphrotomie réalisée. A l’examen clinique, la patiente est apyrétique, sans signe d’hématurie visualisé, cependant sur le trajet du geste opératoire ont observe une fistule pariétale lombaire. Le bilan biologique réalisé, montre un taux d’hémoglobine bas à 9.9g/dl, les leucocytes à 18, 5µ/L, la créatininemie à 17mg/l, l’urée à 0, 78g/l et le temps de prothrombine diminué à 75%. L’échographie rénale d’urgence a montré une dilatation modérée des voies excrétrices sans obstacle lithiasique ni retentissement morphologique rénale. Ainsi, une sonde urétérale double J est montée pour le drainage urinaire, sanctionné d’une bonne évolution biologique de la fonction rénale.
Après un mois, l’évolution clinique est marquée par l’apparition et l’aggravation de l’hématurie de moyenne abondance s’accompagnant d’un retentissement hémodynamique clinique et biologique, une déglobulisation revenue à 8, 8g/dl ainsi que l’aggravation de la fonction rénale avec une créatininémie à 52mg/l. L’altération du tableau a nécessité la réalisation d’une tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdominale avec injection de produit de contraste iodé, bien tolérée. Elle objective un anévrisme d’origine iatrogène de l’artère inter lobulaire faisant 10mm de grand axe associé à un hématome sous scapulaire et une fistule néphro-pariétale lombaire. Il s’y associe également une collection péri rénale et une lithiase calicielle inferieure non obstructive . La patiente a bénéficié d’urgence d’une embolisation sélective à la colle biologique du faux anévrisme intra rénal polaire inferieur . Le geste thérapeutique est sanctionné d’un tarissement progressif de l’hématurie et une amélioration progressive du bilan biologique. Dans les suites d’une évolution favorable, la patiente est déclarée sortante avec réhydratation orale et un suivi en consultation externe.

CR_FRE_6,French,"Informations du patient: patient âgé de 50 ans ayant comme antécédent un diabète type II sous insulinothérapie. Il s´est présenté pour des troubles d´équilibre (troubles de marche, chutes fréquentes, maladresse dans les mouvements, vertiges) et lenteur de parole sans autres symptômes associés, remontant à 15 mois avant l´admission.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen clinique a trouvé un performance status à 3, un syndrome cérébelleux statique et cinétique fait d´ataxie cérébelleuse, hypermétrie, et dysarthrie, sans autres anomalies associées.
Démarche diagnostique: l´IRM cérébrale a objectivé une granulomatose inflammatoire (hypersignal T 2, isosignal T 1) au niveau du vermis, hémisphères cérébelleux et de la région hippocampique. Le scanner cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvien a montré un aspect de reins chevelus sur fibrose rétropéritonéale engainante étendu aux sinus rénaux, avec dilatation des cavités pyélocalicielles et urétéro-hydronéphrose bilatérale, un épaississement mural péri-aortique, atteinte osseuse à type d´ostéosclérose et condensation en verre dépoli du massif facial, sternum, métaphyses des humérus et des fémurs, ainsi que des micronodules sous pleuraux. La biopsie fémorale gauche a été en faveur de la maladie de Erdheim Chester, avec des logettes osseuses siège d´un infiltrat inflammatoire fait de lymphocytes et de rares polynucléaires neutrophiles, mêlé à de nombreuses cellules vacuolaires d´allure histiocytaires, avec présence de turgescence endothéliale et de suffisions hémorragiques, l´immunohistochimie a objectivé une expression cytoplasmique histiocytaires de CD 68. La mutation BRAF est non réalisable dans notre contexte. La numération sanguine a été normale. La ponction lombaire exploratrice n´a pas montré d´anomalies. Un syndrome inflammatoire biologique a été noté avec une CRP à 86mg/l. le bilan endocrinien (lipidique, thyroïdien, glycémique) ainsi que la fonction rénale et hépatique n´ont pas montré d´anomalies. Le diagnostic de maladie de Erdheim Chester systémique symptomatique dans sa forme agressive avec atteinte neurologique, rétropéritonéale, rénale et osseuse a été retenu.
Intervention thérapeutique: le patient a été inclus dans un protocole à base de cladribine à raison de 14mg/kg/jour de J1 à J5 tous les 28 jours. Il a reçu 6 cycles thérapeutiques au total, en parallèle avec un traitement symptomatique (kinésithérapie avec rééducation à la marche et orthophonie).
Suivi et résultats: une bonne amélioration clinique au décours du traitement a été notée avec une régression du syndrome cérébelleux et disparition de la dysarthrie. Le scanner cérébral et thoraco-abdomino-pelvien d´évaluation en fin du traitement ont montré une disparition complète des lésions neurologiques, une régression d´infiltration périrénale avec une persistance d´ostéocondensation osseuse minime uniquement au niveau maxillaire et des têtes humérales.

CR_FRE_7,French,"Il s'agit d'un patient âgé de 40 ans, hospitalisé au service de chirurgie thoracique pour double tuméfactions de la paroi thoracique. En dehors d'un tabagisme, il ne présente pas d'antécédents médico-chirurgicaux particuliers, et notamment pas de notion de contage tuberculeux. Il présentait des douleurs thoraciques postérieures droites au niveau de sa cote flottante irradiant en antérieure, Il s'y associe deux tuméfactions inflammatoires augmentant rapidement de volume: l'une postérieure occupant tout le flanc droit, et l'autre antérieure en regard de la 6éme cote droite, le tout évoluant dans un contexte fébrile à 38°C, d'asthénie et d'altération de l′état général. L′examen clinique trouvait un mauvais état buccodentaire, une pâleur cutanéo-muqueuse, un blindage pariétal en regard des deux masses responsable d'une matité basale droite et d'une diminution des vibrations vocales. L′auscultation pulmonaire est normale et le reste de l'examen était sans anomalie; en particulier l'examen de l'abdomen et ORL était normal, les aires ganglionnaires étaient libres.
Le bilan biologique montrait une vitesse de sédimentation accélérée à 80 mm à la première heure, une hyperleucocytose à 15600 éléments par mm3, à prédominance polynucléaire neutrophile (76%). La recherche de bacille de Koch dans les crachats faite successivement à trois reprises était négative, ainsi que l'intradermoréaction à la tuberculine. La sérologie HIV est négative, l'électrophorèse des protéines et le dosage des immunoglobulines se sont révélés normaux. La radiographie thoracique de face objectivait une opacité du cul de sac costo-diaphragmatique. La fibroscopie bronchique était normale. Une échographie de la masse pariétale antérieure avait montré : une masse pariétale et endothoracique basale droite tissulaire vascularisé au Doppler, de 6, 6 cm d'axe transverse sur 4, 4 cm d'axe antéropostérieur . Au scanner thoraco-abdominal, c'est une masse pariétale antérieure a la limite entre l'étage thoracique et abdominal et une autre postérieure a peine visible avec une atteinte du parenchyme pulmonaire (à noter que le scanner thoracique a été réalisé 18 jours avant que le patient ne soit admis au service de chirurgie thoracique), laissant suspecter une origine néoplasique. La biopsie réalisée chez le patient au niveau de la masse pariétale antérieure a permis de prélever des fragments tissulaires friables avec issue du pus, l'étude anatomopathologique de la biopsie révélait le diagnostic d′actinomycose en montrant des grains d′actinomyces; la culture n'a pas été faite. Le patient fut mis sous traitement médical à base d′amoxicilline-acide clavulanique à raison de 3 grammes par jour par voie orale pendant 6 mois (le patient refusant l'hospitalisation) avec une bonne évolution clinique jugée sur l'apyrexie, une prise de poids et la diminution de volume de la tuméfaction.","

L’IRM (imagerie par résonnance magnétique) cérébrale n’a trouvée aucun signe en faveur d’une hydrocéphalie, d’œdème cérébral, ou de processus expansif intra-crânien. L’examen ophtalmologique a objectivé une altération bilatérale marquée du champ visuel. La ponction lombaire (PL) a permis de confirmer l’hyperpression intra-crânienne, de soulager la patiente et de réaliser l’analyse biologique du LCR revenue normale, permettant ainsi d’affirmer le diagnostic. Aussi, un traitement à base d’acétazolamide 1000 puis 1500mg/j visant à réduire la production du LCR par les plexus choroïdes a été instauré avec cependant la récurence des épisodes d’HTIC d’où la réalisation d’une dérivation du LCR par shunt lombo-péritonéal.

CR_FRE_10,French,"informations de la patiente: le deuxième cas est de madame B. N., âgée de 41 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, quatrième pare qui était suivie pour un nodule du sein droit.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen initial objectivait un nodule de 10 mm au niveau du QSED, de consistances dures, mobiles et douloureuses à la palpation.
Evaluation diagnostique: on a complété par une écho-mammographie qui a montré une opacité stellaire en regard du nodule palpé. Le sein droit a été classé ACR4. Nous avons complété par la suite par une micro biopsie qui a montré une tumeur desmoïde du sein droit.
Intervention thérapeutique: la patiente a alors bénéficié d´une tumorectomie du sein droit avec une recoupe profonde. L´examen anatomopathologique avait conclu à une tumeur desmoïde du sein droit mesurant 2x1, 5cm. En effet, l´examen microscopique montrait une prolifération mésenchymateuse mal limitée de cellularité variable. Elle était formée des zones d´aspect tantôt lâche, tantôt fibreux. Les zones fibreuses sont faites de cellules fusiformes disposées en faisceaux. Ces cellules avaient un cytoplasme peu abondant et un noyau allongé d´allure fibroblastique et sans atypies. Les mitoses étaient rares (1 mitose/10 champs au fort grossissement) A, B et C). La tumeur était focalement située au contact de la limite interne et à distance des autres limites latérales et des plans profond et superficiel. Les recoupes profondes et musculaires sont saines. A l´immunohistochimie, les cellules tumorales ont exprimé la bêta-caténine D).
Suivi et résultat: le dossier était présenté au staff multidisciplinaire (gynécologie, carcinologie, radiothérapie…) et la patiente était proposée pour reprise et recoupe interne suivis d´un complément de radiothérapie. L´évolution était sans particularités, sans récidive tumorale.","

CR_FRE_11,French,"Mme X, âgée de 32 ans, gestante de 37 semaines d'aménorrhée (SA), deuxième geste, primipare a été admise aux urgences obstétricales pour trouble de la conscience, dyspnée et fièvre. L'interrogatoire a retrouvé une fièvre associée à des courbatures et à des céphalées survenues 7 jours avant son admission. Elle a consulté un centre de santé urbain où elle a bénéficié d'une traitement antipaludique. L'évolution sous ce traitement a été marquée par la persistance de la fièvre et par l'apparition d'une polydipsie associée à une polyphagie, une polyurie, des vomissements et des douleurs abdominales diffuses. Devant ces signes aucun traitement n'a été administré. La survenue d'une dyspnée et d'une obnubilation, a motivé son admission aux urgences obstétricales du Centre Hospitalier et Universitaire (CHU) de Bouaké. On retrouvait dans le carnet de maternité 4 consultations prénatales (CPN) de bonne qualité, un antécédent familial de diabète (tante diabétique de type 2), un antécédent personnel d'avortement tardif (5e mois de grossesse) et un bilan prénatal normal. Le poids avant la grossesse était de 90kg pour une taille de 1.69m soit un indice de masse corporelle à 31.5kg/m2. L'examen physique à l'admission a retrouvé une patiente obnubilée avec un score de Glasgow à 10. La fréquence respiratoire était à 38 cycles/mn, la fréquence cardiaque à 125 battements/mn, la pression artérielle à 110/60 mm/Hg, la température à 39o C avec des signes de déshydratation globale. L'examen obstétrical notait une absence des mouvements actifs fœtaux (MAF). L'échographie obstétricale réalisée en urgence a permis de confirmer la mort fœtale in utero avec présence d'une hydramnios de 3 litres. Au plan biologique, la glycémie veineuse était à 5.45 g/l avec une glycosurie et une cétonurie à plus de quatre croix à la bandelette réactive. La goutte épaisse était positive à 3000 trophozoites/mm3 et la numération formule sanguine (NFS) notait une absence d'hyperleucocytose (GB: 9, 36.103 /uL), un taux d'hémoglobine à 16.9g/dl, un hématocrite à 55% et les plaquettes à 236.103/uL. L'ionogramme sanguin a retrouvé une hyponatrémie à 127mEq/l, une hypokaliémie à 3mEq/l et une chlorémie à 138mEq/l. On notait une cytolyse hépatique (TGO:214UI/L et TGP:121UI/L).
L'examen cytobactériologique des urines était normal avec une absence de protéinurie. Le diagnostic d'acidocétose diabétique associé à un paludisme grave type neurologique avec une mort fœtale in utero a été posé immédiatement en milieu obstétrical. La patiente a été transférée en réanimation pour prise en charge thérapeutique. Les gaz du sang ont mis en évidence une acidose métabolique (pH = 7.15; PaO2 = 90mmHg; PaCO2= 30mmHg et bicarbonates= 15 mEq/l). L'osmolarité calculée était à 327 mmoles. Le bilan de coagulation réalisé est revenu normale. La prise en charge en soins intensifs comportait une insulinothérapie par seringue autopulsée à 10Ul/h au début avec une modulation de la vitesse selon l'évolution des glycémies, un traitement antipaludique par l'artésunate, une réhydratation et une oxygénothérapie 6l/mn au masque. La prise en charge obstétricale a consisté en la réalisation d'une césarienne faite sous anesthésie générale qui a permis d'extraire un nouveau-né masculin mort-né macéré avec un poids de naissance à 3950g. L'évolution clinique et biologique a été rapidement favorable à J2 d'hospitalisation, avec une normalisation du pH, normalisation des glycémies, disparition de la cétonurie et de la glycosurie. La patiente a été par la suite transférée à J5 d'hospitalisation en diabétologie pour la poursuite de sa prise en charge et son éducation thérapeutique.

CR_FRE_13,French,"Il s'agissait d'un nourrisson de 24 semaines, de sexe féminin, amené par les parents en consultation pour une tuméfaction douloureuse de l'ombilic. L'interrogatoire a retrouvé un début 24 heures environ avant admission par des pleurs incessantes exacerbés au toucher de l'ombilic, associés secondairement à une fièvre non chiffrée. Il n'y avait pas de signes d'occlusion, ni d'hémorragie digestive, mais une malformation ano-rectale avec fistule recto-vestibulaire était associée. L'examen physique initial avait retrouvé: un bon état général, un syndrome infectieux (hyperthermie à 39, 1 degrés, tachycardie à 102 pulsations par minutes), une tuméfaction ombilicale non expansive à la toux, irréductible et douloureuse avec un maximum de douleur au collet. Les autres orifices herniaires étaient libres. Le diagnostic de hernie ombilicale étranglée a été retenu. Les tentatives de réduction par taxis furent vaines, indiquant l'intervention chirurgicale. En per opératoire, à l'ouverture du sac herniaire, on y avait découvert un diverticule de Meckel inflammatoire . On a procédé à une résection cunéiforme du diverticule, une suture en surjet de la brèche intestinale et une réfection pariétale par des points de fil résorbable.

CR_FRE_16,French,"Mr B. A, âge 71 ans, aux antécédents de cholécystectomie il ‘y a 7 mois, il s'est présenté pour ictère choléstatique. A l'examen clinique, il présentait un ictère cutanéo-muqueux cholestatique, associé à une altération de l’état générale (5kg/ 3 mois). La biologie a montré un bilan de cholestase et de cytolyse élevé. Une échographie, faite à titre externe, parle d'une masse kystique de la tête du pancréas avec dilatation bicanalaire, suite à laquelle il a été adréssé chez nous au service pour complément IRM. L'IRM faite le 24/01/2011 montre une masse liquidienne uniloculaire de la tête du pancréas qui mesure 3 cm, à paroi épaissie qui prend le contraste, le contenu est hétérogène, avec dilatation bicanalaire (wirsung et VBP), sans individualisation de communication avec les canaux pancréatiques, pouvant être en rapport avec un cystadénome mucineux, cependant un adénocarcinome kystique est à évoquer aussi .
La décision des chirurgiens était de programmer le patient pour duodéno-pancréatectomie céphalique, après avoir réaliser un scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien dans le cadre du bilan d'extension. Le scanner a conclu aux mêmes donnés de l'IRM et en l'absence d'extension locorégionale ou à distance. Sauf qu'on est surpris par la découverte sur le PACS d'un scanner fait le mois 05/2010 montrant des signes de pancréatite aigue stade E, avec présence de calculs vésiculaire et cholédocien sans individualisation de lésion kystique . Devant ce contexte, on a retenu le faux kyste de pancréas comme diagnostic final de cette masse kystique.
Ce faux kyste est devenu compressif, avec installation d'ictère, de douleurs épigastriques, de vomissements alimentaires et dyspepsie. Une IRM de contrôle a été réalisée le mois 10/2011 objectivant la majoration en taille de la lésion kystique du pancréas (50mm versus 30 mm) sans signes d'atypie, avec persistance de la dilatation bicanalaire. Cette fois-ci les gastro-entérologues ont décidé de drainer cette collection par fibroscopie, mais le kyste s'est affaissé spontanément avant la réalisation du geste endoscopique .
L’évolution ultérieure était marquée par l'apparition, le mois 12/2011, d'hématémèses et mélénas de grande abondance. Un angioscanner, réalisé le 22/12/2011, montre un blush artériel en rapport avec une rupture d'un faux anévrysme sur une arcade duodéno-pancréatique . le patient a été transféré vers un autre centre pour embolisation, un angioscanner refait a montré l'absence de blush et la thrombose du faux anévrysme.","

Elle était admise au service de psychiatrie pour troubles de comportements, la patiente avait présenté une instabilité psychomotrice, un délire de persécution et mystico-religieux et des hallucinations auditives, sans troubles de la conscience. Elle avait été mise sous un neuroleptique atypique (Amisulpride 600mg /j) et un anxiolytique benzodiazépinique (temesta 7, 5mg/j). 72 heures après, la patiente avait développé une symptomatologie faite d'une obnubilation de la conscience, une hypersudation, une hypertonie plastique surtout aux membres supérieurs, un tremblement des extrémités et une hypersudation. Il n'y avait pas de déficit moteur et la motricité oculaire était conservée. Sur le plan général, elle était tachycarde, la tension artérielle était à 90/50 mm Hg. La température était à 37°C. Devant ce tableau clinique, nous avions évoqué le diagnostic de syndrome malin des neuroleptiques même en absence de fièvre. Le traitement neuroleptique fut arrêté et La malade avait été adressée au service de réanimation en urgence. La NFS, La VS et l'ionogramme étaient normaux. La créatine phosphokinase (CPK) était très élevée 2389 mu/ l. L’électroencéphalogramme (EEG) avait montré un tracé normal. L'IRM encéphalique avec protocole d’épilepsie était normale.

CR_FRE_25,French,"Une patiente de 72 ans hémoglobinopathie SC, gestité 8; parité 5 et ménopausée depuis 19 ans a consulté pour des leucorrhées abondantes persistantes. Le début remontait à deux mois avant la consultation par des leucorrhées blanchâtres, non prurigineuses, abondantes, épaisses, gluantes, non malodorantes. L’interrogatoire ne retrouve pas de notion de fièvre ou d’amaigrissement et elle ne signale ni douleurs pelviennes, ni métrorragies. Il n’a pas été retrouvé de notion de contage tuberculeux.
Devant ce tableau clinique, une infection génitale était évoquée. Un prélèvement de leucorrhée pour examen cytobactériologique et culture avec antibiogramme a été réalisé. La culture a mis en évidence un Stréptococcus agalactatiae sensible à l’association amoxicilline + acide clavulanique. Elle était mise sous cet antibiotique associé à un traitement locale intra-vaginale (polyginax ovule, colposeptine). L’évolution a été marquée par une persistance des leucorrhées. Une échographie pelvienne a été réalisée et a noté un endomètre épaissi avec la présence d’une image hyperéchogène de 15, 1mm x 15, 6 mm au niveau du fond utérin. Une imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) réalisée a noté la présence d’une structure tissulaire endocavitaire de l’utérus, de taille évaluée à 11, 4 mm x 17 mm réalisant une rétention endocavitaire de l’utérus avec absence d’anomalies au reste du pelvis et de l’’etage abdominal . Une cause néoplasique a été suspectée justifiant un curetage biopsique de l’endomètre avec examen anatomo-pathologique. Cet examen retrouvait: « des fragments de muqueuses endométriale; siège d’un tissu de granulation formé de nappes de lymphocytes et de plasmocytes avec de nombreux histiocytes. On retrouvait également des cellules en amas parfois folliculaires, de cellules épithélioides englobant quelques cellules géantes multi nucléées de type Langhans. Une présence de matériel à éosinophile d’allure caséeux ».
Une endométrite granulomateuse d’origine tuberculeuse a été retenue. La recherche des bacilles acido-alcoolo-résistants dans les leucorrhées était négative et la radiographie pulmonaire était normale. Sous traitement anti tuberculeux (2 mois d’une association faite d’éthambutol, rifampicine, isoniazide et pyrazinamide et 4 mois de rifampicine associée à l’isoniazide), l’évolution a été favorable avec une disparition totale des leucorrhées et de la masse.","

Six ans après, la patiente a consulté aux urgences devant la survenue de douleurs pelviennes à type pesanteur, sans signes digestifs associés.
Résultat clinique: l´examen abdominal avait objectivé une légère sensibilité de la fosse iliaque gauche. Les touchers pelviens étaient sans anomalies. L´examen gynécologique n'avait pas mis en évidence le fils du stérilet en intra-vaginal.
Démarche diagnostique: la patiente avait bénéficié d´une échographie pelvienne qui n´avait pas retrouvé le stérilet en intra-utérin. Un scanner abdominal avait été réalisé et avait montré que le DIU était partiellement incrusté dans la paroi du colon sigmoïde. Le diagnostic de perforation secondaire de l'utérus avec migration en intraabdominale et perforation du colon sigmoïde avait été retenu.
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: une laparoscopie à visée thérapeutique avait été indiquée pour la patiente; elle avait confirmé la présence du DIU qui perfore le colon sigmoïde, cependant la tentative de son extraction avait échouée. Une tentative d´extraction par voie endoscopique a été proposée. La coloscopie avait objectivé un corps étranger localisé à 20 cm de la marge anale et correspondant au dispositif intra-utérin .

CR_FRE_29,French,"Le cas concerne un enfant de 3 ans, sans antécédent personnel ou familial particulier, hospitalisé en réanimation pour une détresse respiratoire sévère ayant fait suite à l´aggravation d´une toux et d´un syndrome infectieux, étiquetés initialement comme une bronchite banale trainante, non résolutive sous traitement antibiotique. Devant ce tableau clinique sévère des explorations radiologique et biologique ont été débutées.
Démarche diagnostique et intervention thérapeutique: la radio thoracique a mis en évidence une opacité diffuse de l´hémithorax gauche, refoulant le médiastin, correspondant à un épanchement pleural liquidien de grande abondance, sero-hématique, récidivant après ponctions multiples. Le bilan biologique a montré un important syndrome inflammatoire avec une anémie modérée à 9 g/dl d'hémoglobine et des hémocultures négatives.
Résultat et suivi: la récidive de l'épanchement, la gravité de la détresse respiratoire et la détérioration de l'état général ont motivé la réalisation d´une TDM, d´une échographie thoracique et par la suite d'une thoracoscopie. Ces dernières ont montré respectivement après drainage; la présence d´un épanchement pleural liquidien cloisonné refoulant le médiastin ainsi qu'une condensation parenchymateuse pulmonaire, para-hilaire gauche, de 13 cm de grand axe, correspondant à un processus tumoral malin, solido-kystique, bourgeonnant à la thoracoscopie. Le dosage des marqueurs tumoraux, notamment les LDH, l'α Fœtoprotéine, les β-HCG et l'ACE était négatif.
Les biopsies réalisées lors de la thoracoscopie ont mis en évidence une prolifération tumorale maligne triphasique, solido-kystique, de densité cellulaire variable, avec des contingents blastémateux majoritaires, composés de petites cellules, à noyau basophile ovale, regroupées en petits amas ou dispersées au sein d´un stroma lâche myxoïde; d'un contingent sarcomatoïde fusocellulaire indifférenciés, organisés en bandes et en massifs mais aussi d´un contingent épithélial minime, non carcinomateux, composé de cellules cubo-cylindriques régulières, parfois ciliées, bordant partiellement des pseudo-cavités et formant par endroits des structures tubulaires. Ce revêtement surmonte focalement des nids blastémateux, non rhabdoïdes, simulant un aspect de couche cambiale.
La panCK et l´EMA soulignent uniquement la composante kystique épithéliale non carcinomateuse; la composante blastémateuse exprime focalement la myogénine et les territoires sarcomatoïdes restent indifférenciés (Calrétinine-, CD99-, CD34-, CD31-, PS100-, AML-, Desmine-, MDM2-, NSE-, WT1-, βHCG-, PLAP- et CD45-). Ainsi le diagnostic d'un pleuropneumoblastome de type II a été posé après confrontation radio-clinique et élimination de tout processus tumoral synchrone ou métastatique extra-thoracique. Aucune étude cytogénétique n'a été par ailleurs réalisée chez le patient ou sa famille à la recherche d'une éventuelle mutation du gène DICER1. Suite au caractère agressif de la maladie et à la défaillance multiviscérale, le patient est décédé et n'a pu bénéficier d'un traitement oncologique adéquat.
Consentement éclairé: après des explications claires et détaillées, les parents du patient ont donné leur consentement éclairé pour la réalisation de ce travail vu que l'enfant est mineur.","

CR_FRE_32,French,"Informations de la patiente: il s´agit d´une femme âgée de 61 ans, médecin ophtalmologue de profession, sans antécédents médico-chirurgicaux qui s´est présentée au service de neurophysiologie clinique à l´hôpital de spécialités de Rabat pour un engourdissement intermittent des doigts à prédominance nocturne sans autres signes associés. L´interrogatoire a révélé l´impact psychologique et les inquiétudes de la patiente quant à l´évolution de son affection. Elle rapporte être gênée dans l´exercice de son métier et craignait que celui-ci ne soit impacté négativement du moment qu´il dépend amplement de ses prises manuelles fines et de coordination gestuelle.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen médical de cette patiente s´est révélé normal en dehors d´un signe de Tinel positif bilatéralement. L´examen n´a pas objectivé de limitation de la mobilité passive des deux membres supérieurs et du rachis cervical. L´évaluation de la douleur a été réalisée avec l´Echelle Numérique (EN) et ne trouvait pas de douleur spontanée. Le test de Spurling a été effectué pour écarter une névralgie cervico-brachiale dont les symptômes peuvent ressembler à ceux du SCC, il s´est avéré négatif . Finalement, l´ULNT1 (Upper Limb Neurodynamic Test 1) a été réalisé en bilatéral pour mettre en évidence une mécano-sensibilité des deux nerfs médians et s´est avéré positif à droite à -30° d´extension du coude et à gauche à -20° avec accentuation des symptômes bilatéralement par la manœuvre de différentiation structurelle (inclinaison controlatérale de la tête).
Chronologie: les symptômes de la patiente ont commencé depuis plus d´une année. Après avoir consulté plusieurs spécialistes et essayé plusieurs traitements médicamenteux, les symptômes n´ont pas régressés de manière significative. Conséquemment, la patiente a cumulé plusieurs arrêts de travail.
Démarche diagnostique: l´examen ENMG a montré une conduction nerveuse motrice normale, en particulier des latences distales motrices des nerfs médians dans les limites normales. On ne notait pas de différence significative entre les latences distales motrices entre les nerfs médian et ulnaire. L´examen a par contre objectivé une diminution de la vitesse de conduction sensitive de traversée du canal carpien pour le nerf médian droit à la stimulation de la paume et du troisième doigt et à la stimulation de la paume pour le nerf médian gauche concluant ainsi à une atteinte bilatérale modérée sensitive du nerf médian prédominant à droite.
Intervention thérapeutique: la patiente a été adressée par son médecin traitant pour 20 séances de rééducation à raison de 2 séances par semaine. L´intervention thérapeutique a consisté en un traitement des interfaces articulaires et musculaires du nerf médian en bilatéral, une mobilisation neurodynamique en glissement et en tension des deux nerfs médians en plus des exercices à reproduire régulièrement à domicile. Pour le traitement des interfaces mécaniques du nerf médian, une mobilisation de postériorisation de la tête humérale ainsi qu´une mobilisation des os carpiens ont été réalisées systématiquement, bilatéralement et passivement par le thérapeute. Dans un deuxième temps, le traitement des interfaces musculaires a consisté en une levée de tension des muscles petits pectoraux, sous-claviers et ronds pronateurs bilatéralement. Le traitement de ces interfaces mécaniques a visé dans un premier temps de permettre au nerf d´avoir un environnement favorable pour son glissement.
Dans un deuxième temps, il a été procédé à la mobilisation neurodynamique en glissement du nerf médian en bilatéral. Concrètement, la patiente a été placée en décubitus dorsal sur la table de traitement, le thérapeute du côté à traiter maintient le bras en abduction à 110°, en rotation externe à 90°, l´avant-bras en supination, le poignet et les doigts en extension avec le coude fléchi à 90°. La mobilisation consiste à étendre le coude jusqu´à l´extension complète possible en même temps de fléchir le poignet ce qui cause un glissement proximal du nerf médian et d´inverser la situation en fléchissant le coude en même temps d´étendre le poignet ce qui cause un glissement distal du nerf médian. C´est la mobilisation en glissement du nerf médian entre le coude et le poignet. Vers la 15e séance, nous avons procédé à la mobilisation en tension du nerf médian en maintenant la même position sus-citée pour la description de la technique du glissement avec le coude maintenu toujours en extension et en mobilisant juste le poignet de flexion à extension. Cette dernière technique a visé de gagner sur l´élasticité du nerf médian dans la limite de mécano-sensibilité tolérée par la patiente. Pour les techniques de mobilisation neurodynamique, 3 séries de 60 secondes chacune ont été réalisées entrecoupées d´un temps de repos de 2 minutes entre elles. Finalement, des exercices d´auto-étirement du muscle petit pectoral et une pression ischémique sur le rond pronateur ont été appris à la patiente en plus des exercices de glissement du nerf médian. Elle a été invitée à les reproduire deux fois par jour chez elle à domicile.
Suivi et résultats des interventions thérapeutiques: à la fin des séances prescrites, la patiente a été évaluée concernant la douleur (0 sur l´EN), la mécano-sensibilité du nerf médian bilatéralement (pas de reproduction de symptômes avec l´ULNT1 et l´inclinaison controlatérale de la tête bilatéralement) et une satisfaction quant à la disparition de l´engourdissement nocturne des doigts. Le résume l´examen clinique avant et après l´intervention. L´examen ENMG de contrôle a montré une très nette amélioration des paramètres de conduction des nerfs médians aussi bien des différences de latence motrices entre nerfs médian et ulnaire (avec recueil sur les muscles premier lombrical et 2e interosseux) qui ont nettement diminué, que la normalisation des vitesses de conduction sensitive à la stimulation de la paume et du 3e doigt. Seule persistait une discrète différence de latence distale sensitive entre nerf médian et ulnaire au 4e doigt à droite, cette différence était normale à gauche. Les et montrent les principaux paramètres ENMG avant et après traitement.
Perspectives du patient: la patiente a exprimé sa satisfaction concernant sa prise en charge et les résultats obtenus.

CR_FRE_34,French,"Il s'agissait d'une demoiselle âgée de 25 ans, étudiante, qui nous avait été référée du Centre Hospitalier de Kara pour une insuffisance rénale (IR) oligo-anurique avec une créatinémie à 2210μmol/l, urémie à 46 mmol/l et une anémie sévère à 5g/dl. Il faut noter la prise de médicament traditionnel par voie orale et endovaginale il y a trois jours dans le but de régulariser son cycle menstruel. Elle ne présentait aucun antécédent personnel et il n'y avait pas de commémoratif familial de néphropathie. Elle était nulligeste nullipare et n'avait signalé aucun traumatisme abdominal notable précédant l'hospitalisation. L'examen clinique à l'entrée avait noté une pression artérielle à 120/80 mmHg, un bon état général, un syndrome anémique clinique, un abdomen légèrement augmenté de volume et des lésions ulcéreuses endovaginales. La première biologie a confirmé l'IR majeure avec 2652 μmol/l de créatinine et 50 mmol/l d'urée, l'ionogramme sanguin était normal, et la NFS notait une anémie sévère à 4, 5g/dl et une thrombopénie à 88000 /mm3. Devant ce tableau, elle a été hospitalisée dans un service de soins intensifs, et avait été mise en hémodialyse quotidienne avec des séances courtes de 2 heures de temps et avait bénéficié d'une transfusion de 5 poches de culot globulaire. Trois jours après la patiente avait signalé des douleurs abdominales. L'examen de cet abdomen avait montré un abdomen souple, mât, augmenté de volume, sensible dans son ensemble avec un cri de l'ombilic. Le dosage des beta HCG plasmatique était négatif. Deux échographies abdominales réalisées tour à tour avaient montré un liquide anéchogène de grande abondance avec un utérus vide et non gravide. Une ponction exploratrice réalisée avait ramené un liquide hématique non coagulable. Les reins étaient modérément dédifférenciés de taille conservée. On notait ailleurs une hépatomégalie homogène aux pourtours réguliers avec un pancréas normal. Une nouvelle biologie réalisée avait permis de noter la persistance de l'anémie malgré les transfusions itératives avec un taux d'hémoglobine à 6, 2g/dl sans schizocytes, l'haptoglobine était normale, les LDH à 600 UI/l, une thrombopénie à 45000/mm3, un TP à 31 %, les D-dimères à 800 ng/ml. Il n'y avait pas de troubles phosphocalcique, l'électrophorèse des protides sériques était normale. Une tomodensitométrie abdominale réalisée avait permis d'objectiver un hématome sous capsulaire spontané rompu de la rate . Une prise en charge chirurgicale avec splénectomie totale avait été réalisée après correction des troubles de l'hémostase. L'examen anatomopathologique réalisé confirme qu'il s'agissait bien d'un hématome sous capsulaire avec fracture de la rate sans signe de malignité . Les suites opératoires avaient été simples. Les séances de dialyse s'étaient poursuivies avec une crise polyurique survenue au cinquième jour post opératoire. Le bilan sanguin réalisé avait montré un taux d'hémoglobine à 10g/dl, les plaquettes à 135000/mm3, Un TP à 65 %, une urémie à 11, 6mmol/l et une créatininémie à 530μmol/l. A 4 semaines de l'hospitalisation, elle a présenté une récupération partielle de sa fonction rénale qui s'est stabilisée autour de 265μmol/l de créatinine équivalent à une clairance MDRD calculée à 25, 52ml/min/1, 73m2.","

Au 21ème jour du traitement, la patiente a présenté une éruption cutanée macculo papuleuse généralisée sans atteinte des muqueuses, associée à un oedème du visage et une fièvre chiffrée à 38.5°. L'examen clinique n'a pas trouvé une hépatosplénomégalie ou une adénopathie périphérique. Le bilan biologique a noté une hyper éosinophilie à 3570/mm3. Le traitement antituberculeux a été arrêté, et la patiente a été mise sous traitement antihistaminique et sous corticothérapie orale. La radio thoracique et l’échographie abdominale étaient sans anomalies, une biopsie cutanée revenue en faveur d'une toxidermie. Après 4 semaines, l’évolution a été marquée par la disparition complète des lésions cutanées et la normalisation du bilan biologique. Une réintroduction du traitement antituberculeux a été démarrée progressivement sous surveillance médicale (1er jour: ¼ de la dose, 2ème jour: ½ de la dose, 3ème jour: dose complète). La réintroduction progressive de l'Ethombutol à la dose de 400 mg est suivie une heure après par l'apparition d'une éruption cutanée au niveau du visage et des deux membres supérieurs, cette symptomatologie est rapidement régressive sous antihistaminiques. La réintroduction progressive de la pyrazinamide à la dose de 400 mg est suivie une heure après également par la réapparition des lésions cutanées motivant l'arrêt de la pyrazinamide. Après la disparition des lésions cutanées, une réintroduction de l'isoniazide à la dose de 50 mg a été suivie une heure après par l'apparition de la même symptomatologie précédente.
Quelques jours après la disparition des lésions cutanées, une accoutumance séparée aux antibacillaires a été démarrée après l'accord de la patiente et sous surveillance médicale. Nous avons commencé par 1/1000000 (10−6) de la dose thérapeutique pour chaque médicament et nous avons doublé la concentration toutes les 30 mn . L'accoutumance à l'isoniazide, à la rifampicine et au pyrazinamide s'est déroulée sans incidents. A 16 mg de l'ETB, la patiente a présenté un oedème du visage, des lésions érythémateuses généralisées, une hypotension et une fièvre, ce qui nous conduira à un arrêt définitif de l'ETB.","

CR_FRE_44,French,"Informations du patient: il s´agit d´un patient âgé de 58 ans, tabagique chronique à raison de 40 paquets années, a consulté en dermatologie pour l´apparition de façon symétrique au niveau des deux pommettes de plaques irrégulières, pigmentées, verruqueuses, de couleur brunâtre devenant de plus en plus sombre, indolores et augmentant progressivement de taille. Un bilan biologique demandé était normal à savoir une glycémie à jeun et une cortisolémie de 8h00. Le patient a été mis sous traitement symptomatique, une crème à base de vitamine A à été prescrite. Trois mois plus tard, l´évolution a été marquée par l´accentuation des lésions dermatologiques du visage et l´installation d´une toux productive avec hémoptysie de faible abondance, associée à des névralgies cervico-brachiales droites, évoluant dans un contexte de fléchissement de l´état général.
Résultats cliniques: l'examen clinique pleuropulmonaire a objectivé un syndrome de condensation apical de l´hémithorax droit. L'examen cutanéo-muqueux a montré des plaques pigmentées, brunes, épaisses et papillomateuses, mesurant 4 à 5 cm de grand diamètre et intéressant de façon symétrique les régions sous-orbitaires sans d´autres localisations faisant évoquer un acanthosis nigricans. L´examen du cuir chevelu a noté la présence d´un nodule sous cutané de 2cm de diamètre, de caractère ferme, indolore et mobile siégeant dans la région pariétale droite .
Démarche diagnostique: la radiographie thoracique de face a objectivé une opacité hétérogène et rétractile prenant la moitié supérieure du champ pulmonaire droit, associée à des opacités nodulaires et macronodulaires diffuses bilatérales en lâcher de ballons . La TDM thoracique a mis en évidence une masse tissulaire apico-hilaire droite, à centre nécrosé, des limites irrégulieres, avec une adénopathie sous-carinaire . La fibroscopie bronchique a objectivé un bourgeon tumoral blanchâtre obstruant complétement l'orifice de la bronche lobaire supérieure droite . Des biopsies ont été faites, l´étude anatomopathologique et l´immunohistochimie ont confirmé le diagnostic de l'adénocarcinome bronchique primitif. La biopsie du nodule sous-cutané a été faite et l'histologie a confirmé qu´il s´agit d'une métastase cutanée d´un adénocarcinome bronchique.

CR_FRE_48,French,"Il s’agissait d’un patient de 60 ans, suivis depuis 10 ans pour broncho-pneumopathie chronique obstructive (BPCO), bien équilibrée sous traitement de fond à base de bronchodilatateurs et de corticoïdes inhalés. Opéré en 2013 pour exérèse d’une lésion de la base de la langue (cystadénolymphome). Dans ces antécédents toxiques on retrouvait un tabagisme chronique à raison de 42 paquets année, ainsi qu’un alcoolisme occasionnel. Le début de sa symptomatologie remontait à 4 mois par l’installation d’une dysphagie progressive à évolution intermittente sous traitement à base de corticoïdes, accompagné d’une dysphonie, le tout évoluant dans contexte d’altération de l’état général et d’amaigrissement chiffré à 12 kg en deux mois. L’examen clinique retrouvait un patient apyrétique, eupnéique au repos, sans adénopathies cervical palpable, le reste de l’examen somatique était sans particularités. La laryngoscopie indirecte avait objectivé un processus bourgeonnant de l’hémi larynx gauche et du sinus piriforme gauche. Une tomodensitométrie (TDM) du larynx retrouvait un gros processus tumoral manifestement malin de l’hémi larynx gauche, de 23, 5 mm de diamètre transverse, 33 mm de diamètre antéropostérieur, et étendu en hauteur sur 31 mm, intéressant la corde vocale, le ventricule laryngé, le pli vestibulaire et comblant en partie le sinus piriforme gauche, ce processus lésionnel est responsable d’un phénomène de lyse osseuse de la paroi antérolatérale gauche du cartilage thyroïde et de l’aryténoïde gauche. Le patient était candidat d’une laryngoscopie directe en suspension.
L’évaluation pré-anesthésique retrouvait lors de l’examen de l’appareil respiratoire une dyspnée stade II de NYHA avec une tolérance modérée à l’effort. L’auscultation des deux champs pulmonaires retrouvait de faibles sibilants basaux bilatéraux, la pression non invasive (PNI) était de 141 mmHg/85 mmHg avec une fréquence cardiaque de 93 battements/min, la saturation pulsée en oxygène (SpO2) était de 95% à l’air ambiant. Le patient ne présentait pas de critères d’intubation ni de ventilation difficile décelable avec une bonne ouverture buccale et un Mallampati I ainsi qu’une distance thyromentonniére supérieur à 6cm. Les examens biologiques à savoir une numération de la formule sanguine, une fonction rénale, un bilan hépatique et radiologique préopératoires à savoir un ECG et une radiographie du thorax ne retrouvaient rien de particulier à part une polyglobulie expliquée par le tabagisme chronique. Au bloc opératoire, un monitorage classique contenant un enregistrement du rythme et de la fréquence cardiaque, la PNI, la Spo2 ainsi que la capnographie a été effectué. Une voie veineuse périphérique au membre supérieur droit a été prise et une pré-oxygénation à 100% de Fio2 a été entamée. L’anesthésie a été induite par du propofol 3mg/kg associé à la lidocaïne 1mg/kg, fentanyl 3ug/kg, et une injection du rocuronium à raison de 0, 5mg/kg. Le patient a été intubé par un tube endotrachéal de 5, 5 mm de diamètre et mis sous ventilation artificielle. 25 mg d’hydrocortisone a été administré. L’entretien de l’anesthésie a été assuré par sévoflurane 1, 4% avec un mélange équimolaire oxygène / protoxyde d’azote. Le monitorage ventilatoire consistait en une surveillance rapprochée de la pression plateau avec comme objectif une pression inférieur à 30 cm H2O. Aucun incident per opératoire n’a été noté. A la fin du geste, et après arrêt des halogénés, une administration du sugammadex à raison de 4mg/kg a été effectué, la décurarisation était rapide et l’extubation a pu avoir lieu 5 minutes après avoir assuré une normothermie et une analgésie. Le geste a duré 15 minutes, et la durée totale d’anesthésie était de 25 minutes. Aucun incident n’a été noté en salle de surveillance post interventionnelle.","

CR_FRE_49,French,"Il s'agit d’un patient âgé de 26 ans, droitier, travailleur manuel, ayant présenté à la suite d'un accident de la voie publique, un traumatisme du poignet droit, avec réception direct sur la paume de la main, poignet en extension. Le bilan radiologique avait montré une fracture du scaphoïde, du capitatum, du pyramidal et de l’apophyse styloïde cubitale, sans luxation des os du carpe (lésion type 1 de Vance). Le patient a été pris en charge dans les 24 heures qui ont suivi le traumatisme. L'abord du poignet était dorsal, longitudinal, centré sur l'interligne radiocarpien, entre le troisième et le quatrième compartiment des extenseurs . Le nerf interosseux postérieur a été coagulé. La réduction anatomique a été ensuite réalisée manuellement sous contrôle visuel, à l'aide de broche et de spatule. L’embrochage de la première rangée des os du carpe est préparé par mise en place de deux broches croisées de Kirschner introduites depuis la facette lunarienne du scaphoïde et deux autres au niveau du triquetrum. L’ostéosynthèse du capitatuma été réalisée par embrochage croisé de la deuxième rangée, les deux broches se terminent au niveau du pole proximale du capitatum . Une immobilisation plâtrée antébrachio-palmaire, prenant la première phalange du pouce et maintenant le poignet en position neutre, est mise en place pour 12 semaines. Les broches sont retirées sous anesthésie locale. La rééducation a durée six mois.
A deux ans de recul, le résultat fonctionnel était très satisfaisant.Cliniquement, le score fonctionnel de Cooney était bon: l’extension était de 60°; la flexion à 50°; la force de serrage moyenne était de 78% par rapport au côté sain.

La patiente était opérée 6 mois auparavant pour un fibrome utérin corporéal antérieur de 7cm, on ne dispose pas du résultat de l´étude anatomopathologique de la pièce opératoire. L´examen clinique avait trouvé une patiente apyrétique avec une pâleur cutanéomuqueuse et une anémie à la biologie. L´échographie pelvienne avait montré une masse hétérogène et bilobée du fond utérin avec extension myométriale . Un complément par l'imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) pelvienne avait confirmé les données de l´échographie en montrant une masse bilobée et hétérogène du dôme utérin de 12cm, infiltrant le myomètre, siège de quelques calcifications, se rehaussant de façon hétérogène après injection de Gadolinium et renfermant une large plage nécrotique, non rehaussée . Le diagnostic d´un fibrome en dégénérescence hydro-myxoïde était le plus probable devant l´âge jeune et l´antécédent de myomectomie, mais une tumeur utérine agressive type sarcome n´était pas éliminée. Une tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdomino-pelvienne avait objectivé une volumineuse masse kystique hétérogène intra utérine sans signes d´infiltration locorégionale et sans adénopathies profondes ou lésions hépatiques avec absence de lésions d´allure secondaire tant à l´étage thoracique qu´abdominal. Le dosage des marqueurs tumoraux (antigène carcino-embryonnaire (ACE) et alphafœto-protéine (AFP)) était normal.
Un traitement chirurgical était décidé en réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire. La patiente a eu une énucléation de la masse tumorale avec examen extemporané de la pièce opératoire qui révélait un sarcome stromal utérin, un complément d´hystérectomie totale avec annexectomie bilatérale était réalisé au même temps opératoire. Le résultat définitif d´anatomopathologie confirmait le diagnostic du sarcome du chorion cytogène de bas grade du corps utérin (SUCC) aux dépens de la paroi postérieur qui rompt la séreuse et réalise une masse extra utérine de 10cm sans atteinte annexielle . Le complément d´étude immunohistochimique avait montré une surexpression des récepteurs hormonaux (RE+/RP+). Le bilan d´extension était négatif (radiographie du thorax, radiographie du rachis et du bassin, échographie hépatique et scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien). Un traitement adjuvant comportant une radiothérapie et une hormonothérapie a été réalisé avec une évolution ultérieure favorable.","

Le dosage des catécholamines urinaires des 24 heures a montré: métanéphrines à 78 mg (Normale = 40 à 150 mg); normétanéphrines à 1706 mg (Normale = 110 à 320 mg). Les bilans thyroïdiens et parathyroïdiens réalisés dans le cadre de la recherche de néoplasies endocriniennes multiples (NEM) ont été normaux. Une IRM abdominale a révélé une masse sus-rénale gauche de 8 cm de diamètre hétérogène avec une nécrose centrale sans autres localisations. Le bilan biologique standard a été sans particularité.
L’intervention chirurgicale (surrénalectomie gauche par voie trans-péritonéale) a été programmée à 14 semaines d’aménorrhée. Au bloc opératoire, la prise en charge anesthésique a été la suivante: prise de 2 voies veineuses périphériques de bon calibre; Préoxygenation de 5 minutes à FiO2:1; Monitorage: cardioscope, pression non invasive, oxymétrie de pouls, capnographie, température, sonde urinaire; antibioprophylaxie parentérale: 2g amoxicilline-acide clavulanique; induction anesthésique : 300 µg de fentanyl - 500 mg de thiopental - 6mg de vecuronium; prévention médicamenteuse de l’inhalation gastrique par 200 mg de cimetidine et 10 mg de metoclopramide; intubation facile par sonde n° 7; entretien de l’anesthésie par isoflurane et mélange 02/N20 à 50 %vol avec des réinjections de fentanyl; pose d’une ligne artérielle par voie radiale droite pour monitorage de la pression artérielle sanglante et d’une voie veineuse jugulaire interne droite pour surveillance de la pression veineuse centrale et perfusion éventuelle des catécholamines.
La manipulation de la tumeur a entraîné d’une part 4 épisodes d’hyperglycémie (entre 3, 5 et 5 g/l) justifiant une surveillance toutes les 30 minutes de la glycémie capillaire et une insulinothérapie avec une dose totale de 40 unités; et d’autre part des pics d’hypertension artérielle (170-180 /110-120mmHg) jugulés par approfondissement de l’anesthésie (isoflurane MAC 3% avec des bolus de 50 mg de thiopental), renforcement de l’analgésie par des réinjections de fentanyl (dose totale de 600 µg) et une perfusion à la seringue électrique de nicardipine à 1 – 2 mg/h.
L’exérèse de la tumeur a été suivie par des épisodes d’hypotension artérielle (65 -70/45-50mmHg) jugulés par l’adrénaline en perfusion continue à une dose comprise entre 0, 1 et 0, 3 µg/kg/min.
La durée de l’intervention a été de 4 heures, la diurèse per opératoire à 1200 ml et le saignement estimé à 350cc.
L’extubation a été réalisée après réveil complet. L’analgésie postopératoire a été à base de proparacétamol et nefopam. La perfusion continue de l’adrénaline a été diminuée progressivement et arrêtée 12 heures après la fin d’intervention. Le traitement antihypertenseur a été repris devant la réapparition de pics hypertensifs. L’examen histologique a objectivé un phéochromocytome. L’examen obstétrical et l’échographie fœto-placentaire post opératoire n’ont pas montré d’anomalie. Au 7ème jour postopératoire, les métanéphrines urinaires se normalisèrent, et à 20 SA, la pression artérielle a été redevenue normale sans traitement. La patiente a accouché à 38 SA par voie basse après confrontation céphalo-pelvienne, d’une fille de 3.200 kg dont l’examen néonatal a été normal. La mère et l’enfant ont quitté la maternité au 4ème jour.","

Le traitement antibacillaire était instauré, basé sur une quadrithérapie associant L’Isoniazide (5mg/Kg/j, 225mg/j), la Rifampicine(10mg/Kg/j, 450mg/J), l’Ethambutol (18.3mg/Kg/j, 825mg/j) et le Pyrazinamide (26.6mg/Kg/j, 1200mg/j). La durée prévue du traitement était de 12 mois.
L’évolution était marquée par la persistance de la fièvre malgré l’instauration traitement antituberculeux avec altération de l’état général en l’absence de stigmates d’infection patente. Au bilan biologique, la CRP était positive à 60mg /l puis progressivement à 150mg/l sans hyperleucocytose. La procalcitonine était positive à 10mg/l. Les prélèvements bactériologiques (l’étude cytobactériologique des urines, la ponction lombaire, les hémocultures sur milieux aérobique et anaérobique, la coproparasitologie des selles) étaient négatifs. La radiographie des poumons et l’échographie abdomino pelvienne étaient normales, le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien a objectivé des images alvéolo-interstitielles diffuses non spécifiques.
Par ailleurs, la protéinurie était négative, la fonction du greffon était normale et la ciclosporinémie résiduelle était à 80ng/ml. Devant l’apparition de la fièvre sous Ciproxine et Métronidazole et sa persistance jusqu’ au 10ème jour du traitement antibacillaire, une infection mycosique a été évoquée. L’étude mycologique des urines a isolé un Candida non albicans. L’identification de l’espèce du Candida et le fungigramme n’ont pas pu être réalisés. La patiente a été mise sous Fluconazole: 800mg/j. L’hémoculture sur milieu de Sabouraud a secondairement mis en évidence le même germe. Le diagnostic d’une septicémie à Candida non albicans à point de départ urinaire a été retenu. L’apyrexie a été obtenue 48 heures après le début du traitement antimycosique qui a été maintenu pendant 4 semaines. L’évolution a été marquée par l’amélioration clinique et biologique. La surveillance était complexe, elle portait sur quatre paramètres: 1) Le dosage sérique quotidien du taux de la Ciclosporinémie résiduelle. Sachant qu’elle a été abaissée par l’usage de la Rifampicine à un taux de 40ng/ml. Par conséquent, nous avons dû augmenter la dose de la Cyclosporine à 125mg x 2/j. Par la suite, l’introduction du Fluconazole a fait augmenter le taux de la Ciclosporinémie résiduelle à 200ng/ml ayant nécessité le retour à la dose habituelle de la Ciclosporine, soit 50mg x 2/j, qui par la suite a été ajustée après l’arrêt du Fluconazole. 2) La surveillance de la fonction du greffon qui était hebdomadaire pendant les deux premiers mois, puis mensuelle. Elle restait normale tout au long du traitement antituberculeux. 3) Le dosage sérique des antituberculeux (sauf l’Ethambutol) ayant été effectué au cours de la 1ère semaine du traitement anti tuberculeux et qui a montré des taux sériques dans la fourchette cible. Ce dosage a été répété après l’introduction du Fluconazole, le taux sérique de la Rifampicine s’est abaissé à 4mg/l (cibles: 8-12mg/l), la dose a été augmentée de 150mg/j. 4) La surveillance du bilan hépatique qui était hebdomadaire pendant les 2 premiers mois, puis bimensuelle. Elle a montré une cytolyse hépatique au 4ème mois qui a été respectée. L’examen ophtalmologique n’a pas révélé de signes retentissement de l’Ethambutol (névrite optique rétrobulbaire).","

La patiente présentait depuis 2 ans des fuites urinaires permanentes par le vagin avec des cystalgies intermittentes sans autres signes associés. L'examen clinique a trouvé une patiente en bon état général. La patiente avait une synéchie vaginale qui a rendu impossible l'examen gynécologique, mais nous avons néanmoins pu visualiser des fuites urinaires permanentes par l'orifice vaginal au dessus du col vésical (> 3cm du méat urétral). Nous avons réalisé un arbre urinaire sans préparation (AUSP) qui a montré la présence d'un gros calcul se projetant au niveau de l'aire vésical. La cystographie a montré une FVV avec passage important du produit de contraste de la vessie à la cavité utérovaginale. Le complément scannographique (cysto-scanner) a mis en évidence la présence de 3 calculs sur le trajet de la FVV dont le plus grand mesure 6cm de grand axe avec passage du produit de contraste à la cavité utérine à travers la fistule vésico-vaginale . La fonction rénale était correcte et l'examen cytobactériologique des urines était négatif.

D'autant plus qu'il s'agit d'un antécédent de tuberculose uro-génitale. Allons-nous faire l'ablation du calcul en premier puis procéder à la cure de la FVV dans un 2 Après une revue de la littérature, nous avons opté vers un traitement en un seul temps.

L’échographie retrouve une masse tissulaire hypoéchogène hétérogène occupant la moitié supérieure du rein gauche. L'examen TDM, montre un volumineux processus tissulaire polylobé, bien limité, avec quelques calcifications, de 8cm de grand axe, et dont le prise de contraste après injection fait apparaître sur certaines portions un caractère stellaire . Une néphrectomie gauche élargie a été réalisée. La pièce pesait 400 g et mesurait 15×8×5 cm. Il existait a la coupe une volumineuse masse tissulaire polaire, de consistance moelle, de couleur beige avec des remaniements nécrotico-hémorragiques. Microscopiquement, la tumeur était compacte organisée en massifs faits de cellules de taille moyenne à grande circonscrites par une membrane cytoplasmique bien visible. Les noyaux étaient tantôt arrondis, tantôt fripés et pourvus d'un nucléole visible au fort grandissement. Le tout est en faveur d'un carcinome à cellules chromophobes rénal grade II de furhman. Toutes les patientes ont été revues en consultation à un mois, six mois et un an; leur examen clinique a été normal et la tomodensitométrie thoraco-abdominal réalisée après un an n'a pas mis en évidence de récidive locale ni de métastases à distance.","

L'examen clinique d'admission trouve un état hémodynamique stable avec une Tension artérielle à 135 / 85 mmhg et une fréquence cardiaque à 75 battements par minute. A l'auscultation cardiaque le rythme est régulier, sans souffle ni frottement. les poumons sont secs à l'auscultation sans signe périphérique d'insuffisance cardiaque et le reste de l'examen somatique est sans particularité. L’électrocardiogramme basal de repos inscrit un sus-décalage du segment ST en antérieur . La radiographie de thorax est normale. L’échocardiographie retrouve un VG de taille normale, une hypocinésie de la paroi inféroseptale, une fonction systolique ventriculaire gauche conservée (FE à 70% par le simpson biplan), un péricarde libre sans valvulopathie mitroaortique.

CR_FRE_69,French,"La première observation décrit le cas d’un patient de 57 ans, tabagique chronique, sans antécédent pathologique particulier ayant rapporté deux mois avant sa consultation l’apparition des épisodes de détresse respiratoire spontanément résolutifs sans autre signe respiratoire ou extra-respiratoire associé, le tout évoluant dans un contexte d’altération de l’état général. L’examen clinique a objectivé un syndrome de condensation au niveau de tout l’hémi-thorax gauche. La radiographie thoracique de face a montré une opacité de tout l’hémi-champ thoracique gauche dense homogène avec attraction de la trachée, ascension de la coupole diaphragmatique gauche et pincement des espaces inter-costaux. Le complément scannographique a mis en évidence une atélectasie totale du poumon gauche avec individualisation en son sein d’une masse de 64mm. La bronchoscopie a objectivé la présence d’une formation noirâtre et friable obstruant complètement la bronche souche gauche. Les biopsies ont été en faveur d’un carcinome peu différencié non à petites cellules primitif bronchique, l’aspiration bronchique, a mis en évidence la présence de nombreux amas de filaments mycéliens dont l’étude mycologique a permis d’identifier l’espèce d’aspergillus fumigatus . Devant ces éléments cliniques, radiologiques, endoscopiques et les données des examens microscopique et immunohistochimique, le diagnostic d’aspergillome endobronchique associé à un carcinome bronchique a été retenu. Le patient a été mis sous itraconazole à la dose de 400 mg par jour avant de démarrer toute thérapeutique anti-cancéreuse. Une semaine après, l’évolution fut marquée par l’installation d’une détresse respiratoire entraînant le décès du patient dans un tableau d’asphyxie.
La deuxième observation rapporte le cas d’un patient âgé de 55 ans, sans habitudes toxiques et sans antécédents notables, présentant depuis 6 mois une toux, des épisodes récurrentes d’hémoptysie de faible abondance et une dyspnée stade III de la mMRC, évoluant dans un contexte d’altération de l’état général. L’examen clinique a retrouvé un syndrome de condensation pulmonaire droit avec à la radiographie thoracique une opacité pulmonaire apicale droite surmontée d’un croissant gazeux. Le scanner thoracique a montré la présence d’une cavité pulmonaire apicale droite renfermant une image en grelot . Une tuberculose pulmonaire a été éliminée après des recherches de BK dans les expectorations qui sont revenues négatives, aussi le mycobarterium tuberculosis n’a pas été détecté par GenExpert.

L'examen de l'oeil gauche trouve une acuité visuelle à 10/10ème avec un segment antérieur et un fond d'oeil normaux. L'examen général ne trouve pas d'autres signes extra-ophtalmologiques, notamment pas de signes respiratoires ou d'adénopathies palpables. La tomodensitométrie orbitaire objective du coté droit un processus tissulaire intra-orbitaire intra-conique et qui s’étend en supérieur, de densité tissulaire, homogène, ne se réhaussant pas après injection de produit de contraste, avec une exophtalmie homolatérale associée et sans lyse osseuse en regard ni extension intracrânienne . La biopsie de la lésion orbitaire montre un tissu fibro-adipeux remanié par un processus inflammatoire spécifique se caractérisant par la présence de plages de nécrose caséeuse accompagnées d'une réaction épithélio-giganto-cellulaire.

Deux jours après cette prise médicamenteuse, apparaissaient des lésions micropapuleuses prurigineuses généralisées à tout le tégument. Pour traiter cette éruption, une solution de concentré de potasse (deux phalangettes et demie de potasse diluées dans 250 cl d'eau) était appliquée sur tout le tégument. Le lendemain de ce traitement traditionnel, apparaissait une hyperpigmentation de tout le tégument avec une accentuation du prurit et un décollement cutané généralisé les jours suivants.

CR_FRE_73,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d´un patient de sexe masculin, âgé de 42 ans, sans antécédents particuliers, présentant depuis 3 mois une douleur localisée de la région antérieure de la cheville gauche intense et permanente, s'accentuant à la mobilisation et à la marche, résistante aux anti-inflammatoires non stéroïdiens et sans exacerbation nocturne, évoluant dans un contexte apyrétique avec conservation de l'état général. L'examen clinique retrouvait une douleur exquise à la palpation et à la mobilisation de la cheville avec une limitation des mouvements de flexion et extension par la douleur sans tuméfaction ni signes d'inflammation locaux. Une radiographie standard a été réalisée et a été jugée strictement normale . Devant la persistance des plaintes, une TDM a été faite et a montré une petite lacune au niveau de la partie antérieure du pilon tibial évoquant le diagnostic d'ostéochondrite . Une exérèse complète de la lésion a été réalisée et l'histologie a confirmé le diagnostic d'ostéoblastome. L'évolution pendant un an après était satisfaisante, avec disparition de la douleur, une reprise de l'appui après trois semaines et conservation d'une mobilité articulaire normale sans signe de récidive au bilan radiologique de contrôle.","

Elle a présenté 4 mois avant le diagnostic une hématurie macroscopique, accompagnée d'une légère douleur pelvienne. L'examen clinique a trouvé une patiente avec une performance status à 0, asymptomatique avec un examen abdominal et des touchers pelviens sans particularité. Une échographie réalisée a mis en évidence une masse hypoéchogène hétérogène de la paroi antérieure de la vessie mesurant 50mm de grand axe . La patiente a bénéficiéd'une cystoscopie qui a visualisée une masse bourgeonnante au niveau de la paroi vésicale antérieure, saignant au contact. Une résection endoscopiquede la massea été réalisée permettant l'arrêt de l'hématurie et la diminution de la douleur pelvienne. L'examen anatomopathologique du matériel de résection a mis en évidence une prolifération tumorale maligne d'allure sarcomateuse de densité cellulaire élevée. Cette prolifération a été constituée de cellules parfois globoïdes ou souvent fusiformes, agencées en faisceaux entrecroisés, montrant une différentiation musculaire ( a). Ces cellules étaient pourvues de noyaux arrondis ou ovalaires, irréguliers et nucléoles. Les atypies nucléaires étaientmarquées par la présence de cellules géantes tumorales multinucléolées ( b). L'activité mitotique atteignait 15 mitoses par 10 champs au fort grossissement. La vascularisation était assurée par des vaisseaux parfois bordés directement par les cellules tumorales. Cette prolifération infiltrait la muqueuse urothéliale, qui était souvent ulcérée et remaniée par des foyers de nécrose, et le muscle: la tumeur est classée pT2. L'examen imunohistochimique avait mis en évidence un marquage positif et diffus aux anticorps anti-actine muscle lisse (AML) et anti-Hcaldesmone; le marquage à l'anticorps anti cytokératine était absent . Les résultats de l'examen anathomopathologique et immunohistochimique ont conclu à un leiomyosarcome de la vessie de haut grade. Un scanner thoraco-abdomino-pélvien a été réalisé, mettant en évidence un processus lésionnel de structure tissulaire, accolé à la paroi antérieure de la vessie, mesurant 50mm de grand axe . Aucune lésion secondaire à distance n'a été mise en évidence. La tumeur est donc classée T2N0M0.

CR_FRE_81,French,"Mr AB âgé de 67 ans, nous a été adressé par un ophtalmologue pour “délire hallucinatoire”: vision de moustiques qui le piquent, surtout le soir. Il est, en fait, suivi pour cataracte bilatérale, avec rétinopathie diabétique. Il est à la retraite depuis 7 ans, et vit seul avec sa femme depuis plus d'une année, après le “départ” de ses 5 enfants, tous mariés.
L'histoire des troubles remonte à trois mois, dans les suites d'une phacotomie, soit une durée d’évolution d'un an et demi. Elle a été marquée par l'installation progressive de troubles du comportement, soit une attitude d'autoprotection continue par une couverture, en rapport avec la vision de moustiques qu'un intrus dans la maison lui jette dessus. Ces moustiques l'auraient attaqué puis se seraient fixées sur son corps. Il ne cessait d'essayer de les enlever par un grattage incessant, avec des lésions cutanées sévères.
L'attitude initiale de l'ophtalmologue a été de rassurer le patient et de tenter de lui expliquer le caractère plutôt “imaginaire” de ses troubles, espérant, en vain, le convaincre de l'inexistence de ces insectes. Devant l'absence d'amélioration le patient nous a été adressé.
A l'examen, le patient était anxieux, triste, pessimiste et craignant que les moustiques lui sucent son sang. Sa personnalité a été marquée des traits paranoïaques, avec surtout une psychorigidité, et une méfiance. Il présentait un délire d'infestation cutanée, à mécanisme hallucinatoire, cénesthésique et visuel. L'examen psychiatrique a permis d’éliminer une symptomatologie démentielle (MMSE normal) et le scanner cérébral s'est révélé sans particularités. L'examen neurologique a été normal. Notre attitude a été de lui prescrire de façon simultanée un antidépresseur (fluoxétine), un anxiolytique (lorazépam) et un neuroleptique (halopéridol).
L’évolution, au bout de six mois, a été marquée par une amélioration de l'humeur, du sommeil et une réduction de la charge anxieuse, mais le patient a continué à se protéger par sa couverture. Cependant, il ne perturbait plus le fonctionnement familial, et les lésions de grattage se sont cicatrisées.","

Le début de sa symptomatologie clinique remontait à un mois par la survenue de douleurs abdominales paroxystiques diffuses à type de crampes avec vomissements. Son transit s'était modifié avec une tendance à la constipation, parfois associée à des selles liquides. Ce syndrome abdominal a été résolutif puis entrecoupé d'épisodes douloureux paroxystiques jusqu'au jour de son hospitalisation motivée par l'accentuation des douleurs et l'arrêt des matières et des gaz. A l'admission, l'examen clinique objective un abdomen distendu avec tympanisme à la percussion, légèrement sensible, sans masse palpable, les orifices herniaires étaient libres. Le toucher rectal était normal. Le patient était apyrétique. Le reste de l'examen clinique était normal, mais il existait une altération récente de l'état général. Les examens biologiques usuels étaient sans particularité. La radiographie de l'abdomen sans préparation montrait des niveaux hydroaériques grêliques .

L'indication opératoire était formelle. L'intervention chirurgicale, menée par une laparotomie médiane à cheval sur l'ombilic, a permis de confirmer que l'IIA est en rapport avec tumeur d'environ 8 cm de grand axe, située à environ 2m 20 de l'angle de Treitz et à 2m 80 de la valvule iléo-coecale, cette invagination était responsable d'une distension grêlique importante d'amont. Le boudin invaginé était viable. Présence également de plusieurs adénopathies au niveau mésentérique surtout au niveau de la racine du mésentère. Le geste a consisté sur une résection grêlique carcinologique emportant la tumeur et quelques ganglions mésentériques puis anastomose grêlo grêlique termino terminale au même temps, et la réalisation d'une biopsie sur une adénopathie mésentérique. L'étude anatomopathologique et immunohistochimique de la pièce opératoire a conclu à un lymphome anaplasique à grandes cellules de type T (CD30+, ALK-). Les suites opératoires étaient simples et après 3 semaines, le patient était mis sous chimiothérapie adjuvante selon le protocole R-CHOP (Rituximab, Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicine, Vincristine, Prednisone) avec une bonne tolérance et contrôle de la pathologie néoplasique.","

CR_FRE_84,French,"Informations sur la patiente: patiente âgée de 32 ans, aux antécédents d´appendicectomie par voie de Mac Burney à l´âge de 16 ans, G2P2; 2 accouchements par voie césarienne (pour utérus cloisonné) en 2014 et 2017, qui a présenté 4 ans avant son admission, un nodule douloureux au niveau de l´angle gauche de la cicatrice de Pfannenstiel: elle a rapporté un fond douloureux chronique avec une exacerbation cyclique concomitante aux menstruations, par ailleurs elle ne rapporte pas des douleurs similaires en rapport avec la cicatrice de Mac Burney. L´interrogatoire retrouve des dysménorrhées depuis le deuxième accouchement. Depuis quelques mois avant l´admission la patiente rapporte une modification de la coloration de la peau en regard du nodule, devenant bleuâtre pendant les menstruations.
Données de l´examen clinique: l´examen avait trouvé un nodule de 2cm au niveau de l´angle gauche de la cicatrice de Pfannenstiel, la cicatrice de Mac Burney était solide et sans anomalies.
Démarche diagnostique: la TDM abdominale avait trouvé deux nodules de 3x2 cm et de 1x2 cm au niveau des muscle grands droits de part et d´autre en regard de la cicatrice de Pfannenstiel, de même densité avant et après injection de produit de contraste que celle de l´utérus évoquant des lésions d´endométriose. Une Imagerie à Résonance Magnétique (IRM) pelvienne a été réalisée pour mieux identifier les lésions et à la recherche de lésions d´endométriose pelvienne profonde justifiant un éventuel traitement médical. L´IRM pelvienne avait montré un utérus cloisonné, avec présence de multiples nodules endométriosiques sur l´ensemble de la cicatrice opératoire de la césarienne, dont un mesurant 17x 19 mm enchâssés dans la graisse sous cutanée et dans l´épaisseur des muscles droits droit et gauche . Par ailleurs, absence de lésions en faveur d´endométriose pelvienne profonde.
Le traitement chirurgical: la patiente a été opérée en reprenant l´ancienne cicatrice de Pfannenstiel, on retrouve un nodule ayant des rapports avec l´aponévrose du muscle grand droit gauche, et un autre nodule sous aponévrotique ayant des rapports avec les muscles grands droits à droite et s´étendant jusqu´au pubis . Une excision musculaire et aponévrotique large emportant les nodules a été effectuée en passant par du tissu sain réalisant une résection en monobloc. Devant l´importance de la perte de substance sur la paroi abdominale exposant au risque de hernie, une pariétoplastie a été réalisée en interposant une plaque de polypropylène en rétro musculaire préfascial .
Diagnostic final: l´examen anatomopathologique macroscopique révèle 2 pièces graisseuses présentant à la coupe de très nombreux foyers hémorragiques. L´étude histologique a confirmé le diagnostic d´endométriose pariétale avec présence de glandes bordées par un épithélium pseudo stratifié avec présence de chorion cytogène .
Suivi et évolution: les suites opératoires immédiates étaient simples. Le suivi avec un recul de 6 mois n´a pas détecté de récidives.","

CR_FRE_85,French,"Bébé X est un nouveau-né de sexe masculin. Il est né au terme de 39 semaines de gestation, après une grossesse sans particularité, et un accouchement par voie basse (extraction instrumentale). Le poids de naissance était de 3, 5 kilogrammes, le score d´Apgar à 10/10. La mère, Mme Z., âgée de 30 ans, II gestes, I pare, de groupe sanguin O Rhésus positif, avait pour principal antécédent, un avortement spontané précoce à 10 semaines de gestation, un an auparavant.
A la naissance il présentait une petite bosse sérosanguine droite. En 24 heures d´évolution, sont apparus, un hématome cervical droit, un purpura pétéchial diffus, et des ecchymoses aux membres inférieurs. Le bilan biologique avait confirmé la thrombopénie à 4 000 G/mm3 associée à une anémie à 6, 6 g/dl normocytaire, régénérative (réticulocytes à 127 G/mm3), hémolytique à bilirubine libre (bilirubine totale 145 mg/l bilirubine libre 140 mg/l bilirubine conjuguée 5 mg/l, LDH 437UI/l, haptoglobine 0, 33 g/l). Le test de Coombs était négatif. Le groupe sanguin était 0 Rhésus positif. L´échographie transfontanellaire (ETF) mettait en évidence une hémorragie intraventriculaire de grade II. La numération formule sanguine de la mère était sans particularité. Toutes les sérologies infectieuses étaient revenues négatives, ainsi que les anticorps anti nucléaires, et les antiDNA natifs. Le myélogramme était en faveur d´une moelle riche, ou toutes les lignées étaient représentées, avec des mégacaryocytes à tous les stades de maturation.
Bébé X a bénéficié d´une transfusion en culot globulaire érythrocytaire ayant permis la correction de l´hémoglobine (hémoglobine de contrôle à 15, 6 g/dl; bilirubine totale 80 mg/l; bilirubine libre 72 mg/l; bilirubine conjuguée 8, 6 mg/l). La thrombopénie est restée réfractaire (inférieure à 50G/mm3) aux transfusions itératives d´unités plaquettaires non phénoypées, ainsi qu´aux perfusions d´immunoglobulines intraveineuses (IgG IV) associées à la corticothérapie. Bébé X a finalement bénéficié d´une transfusion de plaquettes maternelles irradiées à J12 de vie, associée à une corticothérapie, ayant permis la correction de la numération plaquettaire à 103 G/mm3) puis à 318 G/mm3. Un bilan d'immunologie plaquettaire a été réalisé, mettant en évidence une allo-immunisation materno-fœtale dans le système HPA-1, puisque la mère était HPA-1b homozygote et le père HPA-1a homozygote, et qu'il existait un allo-anticorps anti HPA-1a dans le sérum maternel. Le bilan a également révélé la présence d´autoanticorps antiplaquettes circulants et fixés, participant très probablement à la bicytopénie initiale.
L´évolution ultérieure fut favorable, à partir de J11 de traitement, un sevrage progressif de la corticothérapie fut débuté. L´ETF de contrôle était sans particularité. Un dosage des auto-anticorps anti-plaquettes chez la mère a été réalisé à trois mois. La nécessité d´une surveillance pluridisciplinaire en milieu spécialisé a été expliquée à la mère pour les grossesses ultérieures. Une quantification initiale puis un suivi des anticorps anti HPA-1a chez la mère furent programmés. La mère bénéficiera d´une perfusion d´immunoglobulines à partir de 18 semaines d´aménorrhées dont le rythme dépendra des taux d´anticorps.","

CR_FRE_86,French,"Il s’agit d’un nourrisson de 8 mois, de sexe masculin, né d’une grossesse mal suivie admis dans notre formation pour syndrome poly malformatif et constipation chronique. Dans les antécédents, on ne retrouve pas de notion de consanguinité, ni de malformations dans la fratrie. En revanche on note un diabète de type II chez la mère qui est mal équilibré. L’examen clinique trouve un nourrisson en bon état général, présentant des malformations de la moitié inférieure du corps à type d’hypotrophie des cuisses avec abduction des hanches et flexion irréductible des genoux, réalisant un aspect « frog-like » de l’extrémité inférieure du corps. Il s’y associe un pertuis cutané dorsal d’un sinus dermique. Les organes génitaux externes, l’anus, les membres supérieurs ainsi que la face sont de morphologie normale. Une radiographie standard de face du bassin et des membres inférieurs réalisée a objectivé un bassin rétréci en entonnoir avec raccourcissement des fémurs, abduction des cuisses et flexion des genoux réalisant la position en « frog-like » des membres inférieurs. La radiographie du rachis dorso-lombo-sacré de profil a mis en évidence une agénésie sacro-coccygienne et de la dernière vertèbre lombaire sans autres anomalies de segmentation du rachis sus jacent à l’agénésie. Vu les résultats de l’examen clinique ainsi que la radiographie standard, le diagnostic de syndrome de régression caudale a été retenu. Un index baryté a été réalisé en raison d'une part de la constipation chronique présentée par le nourrisson et d'autres part de la fréquence des malformations ano-rectales associées à l’agénésie sacrée, a révélé un défaut d’expansion rectal siégeant à 5cm de la marge anale, étendu sur 2cm, bien centré, sans distension d’amont mais s'accompagnant d'un retard d’évacuation. Une échographie abdominale, réalisée dans le cadre du bilan malformatif n’a pas révélé d’anomalies rénales, ni de masse pré-sacrée.","

CR_FRE_90,French,"Une patiente de 36 ans a été hospitalisée pour une monoarthrite chronique de l’épaule droite évoluant depuis 4 mois. Ce tableau évoluait dans un contexte de fièvre à 39- 40°, d'asthénie et d'amaigrissement non chiffré. Elle aurait reçu plusieurs traitements (antipaludiques, AINS, antibiotiques: Amoxicilline + Acide Clavulanique, Levofloxacine, Gentamycine dont la durée et la posologie n'ont pu être précisées par la patiente). Ce traitement n'a pas amélioré la symptomatologie. Cette patiente était drépanocytaire SC, et séropositive au VIH 1. Il n'y avait de porte d'entrée patente ni de notion de contage tuberculeux.
A l'examen physique, on notait une température à 38, 8°, une impotence fonctionnelle absolue de l’épaule droite avec une amyotrophie des muscles de l’épaule. Aucun mouvement de l’épaule n’était possible. Localement il n'y avait pas de signes inflammatoires, ni d'adénopathies satellites. Ailleurs l'examen était sans particularité. La biologie était peu perturbée (glycémie, bilan rénal et hépatique normaux) en dehors d'une anémie hypochrome microcytaire à 09, 7gr/dl. Il n'y avait pas de syndrome inflammatoire (une VS à 7 mm à H1, la CRP était négative (00mg/l). L'IDR à la tuberculine était anergique.
A la radiographie standard des épaules, on notait un aspect hétérogène de la tête humérale droite avec une déminéralisation diffuse, et des géodes . Une ponction écho guidée de l’épaule avait retiré du pus franc, et l'examen bactériologique direct a isolé l'Enterobacter Cloacae sensible seulement à (l'Imipenème, Latomoxef, l'Amikacine, la Péfloxacine et la Ciprofloxacine). La patiente a été mise sous une bi antibiothérapie adaptée (imipenème+ amikacine pendant 14 jours, voie parentérale). Devant la persistance de la fièvre, une TDM de l’épaule à été réalisée, elle a mis en évidence une ostéoarthrite de l’épaule (des érosions et des géodes au niveau de la tête humérale, associées à une collection d'allure abcédée des parties molles et intra articulaires) .
Une arthrotomie à été réalisée par le chirurgien, avec drainage des abcès, curetage biopsique et lavage articulaire . L'examen bactériologique direct des prélèvements chirurgicaux a retrouvé le même germe (EC). L'examen histologique quant à lui, a mis en évidence, une réaction granulomateuse faite de cellules épithélioides, de cellules géantes de Langhans et de lymphocytes, avec des plages de foyers de nécrose caséeuse. Le diagnostic final était celui d'une ostéoarthrite de l’épaule à BK et à Enterobacter Cloacae chez une patiente drépanocytaire et immunodéprimée. La patiente a été mise sous traitement antituberculeux pendant une durée d’ un an. La rééducation de l’épaule à été prescrite en post-opératoire. L’évolution immédiate a été marquée par une apyrexie franche à partir de 48 heures avec une régression progressive de la douleur. A 09 mois du traitement, elle ne présentait plus de douleur, à la radiographie on notait une stabilisation des lésions radiologiques avec des images séquellaires . Au plan fonctionnel, elle présentait une raideur de l’épaule avec une impotence fonctionnelle de tout le membre avec amyotrophie. Le score de constant était mauvais.","

CR_FRE_91,French,"Mr E.D âgé de 20 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques particuliers, a été victime le 25 Février 2013 d'un polytraumatisme suite à un accident de la voie publique. Motocycliste non casqué ayant été heurté par un camion, avec notion de perte de connaissance initiale et un écrasement du membre inférieur gauche pendant une durée non précisée. Le patient a été transféré par une ambulance non médicalisée aux urgences du CHU Hassan II de Fès. L'examen à son admission au service d'accueil des urgences, trouvait un patient agité, pâle, polypneique à 25 cycles/min, en état de choc hémorragique avec une pression artérielle à 70/40mmHg et une fréquence cardiaque à 145 batt/min. L'examen neurologique trouvait un patient agité, pupilles égales et réactives, sans signes de localisation. L'examen pleuro-pulmonaire était sans particularité. L'abdomen était souple et le bassin sans particularité. L'examen des membres trouvait une fracture ouverte du fémur gauche avec plaie saignante et abolition des pouls périphériques. Après monitorage, le patient a bénéficié d'une oxygénothérapie, prise de deux voies veineuses périphériques de gros calibre, d'un remplissage vasculaire par des cristalloïdes, d'une transfusion par trois culots globulaires O- et quatre plasmas frais congelés (PFC). Après stabilisation, un angioscanner des membres inférieurs a été réalisé, il a mis en évidence une section complète de l'artère poplitée gauche au niveau de sa partie sus-articulaire du genou. Le reste du bilan paraclinique a montré une tomodensitométrie cérébrale, une radiographie thoracique et une échographie abdominales normales. L'hémoglobine était à 7, 2 g/dl après transfusion, les plaquettes à 206000 éléments/mm3, les globules blancs à 18000 éléments/mm3, une urée à 0, 33g/l une créatinémie à 18 mg/l, un TP à 40%, des créatines phosphokinase (CPK) à 2075 UI/l et une troponine à 1, 85ng/ml. Le patient a été admis au bloc opératoire.
Après induction en séquence rapide, le patient a bénéficié d'un monitorage standard, avec prise d'une voie veineuse centrale jugulaire interne droite. L'exploration chirurgicale a mis en évidence une section - contusion de l'artère poplitée avec des berges déchiquetées. Un pontage avec greffon veineux entre l'artère poplitée et le tronc tibio-péronier a été réalisé, puis le geste chirurgical a été complété par la mise en place d'un fixateur externe pour la fracture fémorale et des aponévrotomies de décharges. En peropératoire, le patient a présenté un saignement estimé à 1000ml, une instabilité hémodynamique ayant nécessité le recours aux fortes doses de drogues vasoactives, avec 1.5μg/kg/min de noradrénaline et 10 μg/kg/min de dobutamine. Le patient a bénéficié d'une transfusion par quatre culots globulaires. La durée de l'intervention était de trois heures. Le patient a été transféré ensuite au service de réanimation polyvalente. Le patient a été mis sous sédation avec midazolam et fentanyl, héparinothérapie curative, drogues vasoactives avec noradrénaline à 1, 7μg/kg/min et dobutamine à 15μg/kg/min, remplissage vasculaire avec cristalloïdes et gélatines fluides modifiées et antibioprophylaxie par amoxicilline et acide clavulanique. Le postopératoire immédiat a été marqué par la survenue de plusieurs complications avec notamment, une insuffisance rénale aigue avec oligurie, des urines foncées, une urée à 0, 58g/l et une créatinémie à 21mg/l, une acidose métabolique, avec un pH à 7, 16, des HCO3- à 17, 2 mmol/l, un excès de base à -10, 5mmol/l et une PaCO2 à 50mmHg, une rhabdomyolyse avec des CPK à 4885 UI/l et une hyperkaliémie à 6 mmol/l, une anémie avec un taux d'hémoglobine à 5, 4g/dl, une thrombopénie à 38000éléments/mm3 et une élévation de la troponine à 2, 41 ng/ml. Le patient a bénéficié d'une transfusion par 5 culots globulaires et 5 PFC, d'un remplissage vasculaire par du sérum salé physiologique 0, 9%, d'une alcalinisation par bicarbonates de sodium et d'une diurèse forcée par du mannitol. Douze heures après, le patient a présenté une ischémie du membre opéré, ce qui a nécessité une amputation transfémorale. L’évolution a été marquée ensuite par une amélioration progressive de l’état hémodynamique permettant un arrêt des drogues vasoactives le 3ème jour postopératoire, une reprise d'une diurèse normale avec éclaircissement des urines, une correction de l'acidose métabolique et une normalisation de la troponine, de la fonction rénale et du taux des plaquettes. Le patient a été extubé le 6ème jour puis il est sorti de l'hôpital 20 jours après.","

Le bilan biologique notait une vitesse de sédimentation à 55 mm à la première heure, et la numération sanguine montrait une anémie hypochrome monocytaire avec une hémoglobine à 9g/100ml et une hyperleucocytose à 12600 éléments par millimètre cube à prédominance neutrophile. L’intradermo-réaction (IDR) à la tuberculine était positive à 25 mm. La sérologie VIH était négative. La ponction de cette masse à l’aiguille avait ramené un liquide blanc nacré contenant du bacille de Koch à l’examen direct. Le patient avait bénéficié d’une mise à plat avec curetage du foyer osseux, l’étude anatomopathologique des prélèvements avait conclu à une tuberculose caséo-folliculaire évolutive. Un traitement anti-bacillaire était débuté avec deux mois de trithérapie (RHZ) associant la rifampicine® 600mg par jour, l’isoniazide(H) 300 mg par jour et la pyrazinamide (Z) 2000 mg par jour et sept mois de bithérapie (RH). Le patient est revue à la fin du 2 mois du traitement, la cicatrice était propre, et la VS à 8 mm à la première heure.","

CR_FRE_93,French,"Madame H. 29 ans est hospitalisée dans le Service de Rhumatologie de notre centre hospitalier pour poussée d′arthralgies diffuses bilatérales et symétriques depuis 04 mois. Elles sont associées à des lésions érythémato papuleuses au niveau du dos des mains. Elle a reçu un traitement à base de corticothérapie à faible dose et de la nivaquine. L’évolution était marquée par l'apparition quelques mois après d'une asthénie progressive associée à une faiblesse musculaire et érythrœdème des paupières. Elle était adressée au Service de Dermatologie. L'examen a trouvé un œdème péri unguéal (signe de la manucure), des ulcérations en regard des articulations inter phalangiennes (papules de Gottron) un érythème héliotrope rose violacé des paupières et des plaques psoriasiformes au niveau des coudes. Ces différents éléments cliniques sont révélateurs d′une dermatomyosite débutante. Le bilan biologique retrouve un syndrome inflammatoire aspécifique, les enzymes musculaires ont des valeurs normales (Créatine Kinase = 33 U/l pour une norme < 170 U/l). L’électromyogramme trouve une atteinte myogène diffuse. Le bilan immunologique est normal. Les explorations fonctionnelles respiratoires retrouvent un syndrome restrictif modéré. Malgré l′absence de la totalité des éléments de la classification de Bohan et Peter en particulier la biopsie musculaire, le diagnostic de dermatomyosite est porté. L′échographie abdominale, la radiographie du thorax, la fibroscopie gastrique, la coloscopie, l'examen ORL et l′examen gynécologique ne retrouvent pas de néoplasie sous jacente. Au terme de ce bilan initial la patiente est mise sous corticothérapie et Imurel avec amélioration partielle de son asthénie et des lésions cutanés. Quelques mois après la mise sous traitement corticoïde d'entretien (faible dose), Madame H. présente de façon progressive une dyspnée d'effort stade II de MRC associée à une toux sèche et des douleurs basi thoraciques d'intensité modérée. L′auscultation pulmonaire trouve quelques crépitants au niveau des deux bases pulmonaires. Une radiographie de thorax de face a été réalisée montrant des opacités réticulo nodulaires bilatérales surtout basales et plus marquée du coté droit en rapport avec un syndrome interstitiel . La tomodensitométrie thoracique (coupes millimétriques en haute résolution sans injection de produit de contraste) réalisée pour une meilleure étude parenchymate use retrouvant les opacités réticulo nodulaires avec DDB par traction et de la fibrose sous pleurale. Il s’ y associe un pneumomédiastin de faible abondance plus marqué dans la région médiastinale antérieure et en péri tracheal . Un traitement symptomatique de la dyspnée est instauré puis la patiente est remise sous immunosuppresseur et corticothérapie à forte dose. L′évolution clinique est favorable avec une amélioration partielle des symptômes respiratoires mais le pneumomédiastin persiste de façon prolongée plusieurs mois après l′épisode initial. Lors d′un contrôle tomodensitométrique 02 mois après traitement, on objective la stabilité des anomalies parenchymateuses pulmonaires observées sur la première tomodensitométrie voir l'aggravation du pneumomédiastin qui s’étend vers les espaces péribronchovasculaires plus distales .","

CR_FRE_94,French,"Il s'agit d'un garçon de 7ans, premier d'une fratrie de quatre enfants, scolarisé en première année primaire qui nous a été adressé de Lambaréné où il vit avec ses parents, pour prise en charge d'un amaigrissement important avec exophtalmie évoluant depuis 10 mois. Il est né au terme d'une grossesse suivie régulièrement. L'interrogatoire n'a pas retrouvé d'antécédents personnels ni familiaux pathologiques particuliers notamment pas de notion de maladie auto immune. La famille n'a pas de problèmes particuliers, le père est monogame. Les symptômes remonteraient à environ 10 mois par la constatation d'un amaigrissement contrastant avec une polyphagie et une énurésie avec refus de se rendre à l'école. Les parents ne comprenaient pas ce qui arrivait à l'enfant et ont consulté plusieurs médecins dans leur ville d'origine sans succès jusqu'au dernier médecin qui a pensé à un problème thyroïdien et nous l'a adressé. En interrogeant directement l'enfant sur ce qui lui était arrivé au début de sa maladie, il nous a raconté dans ses propres mots que le « maître lui avait damé un coup de chicotte sur la tête parce qu'il avait eu tout faux » L'examen clinique a objectivé : Un enfant amaigri pesant 21kgs pour 142cm, dyspnéique avec une labilité émotionnelle pleurant facilement. Il présentait un goitre visible de loin et une exophtalmie. Le goitre était diffus, soufflant à l'auscultation avec un frémissement palpatoire traduisant son hyper vascularisation. Il n'y avait pas d'adénopathies jugulo-carotidiennes satellites. L'examen cardiovasculaire mettait en évidence : une turgescence spontanée des veines jugulaires, un bruit de galop et un souffle d'insuffisance mitrale coté 3/6. La fréquence cardiaque était à 130 par minute, la pression artérielle à 120/68 mmHg. L'examen pleuro-pulmonaire était sans particularité. L'examen neurologique objectivait un tremblement fin des extrémités, une hyperactivité motrice. L'examen cutanéo-muqueux mettait en évidence de multiples lésions de grattage secondaires à un prurit généralisé. L'examen de l'appareil génito-urinaire était sans particularité. L'enfant a été hospitalisé dans le service d'endocrinologie du centre hospitalier universitaire de Libreville où des examens complémentaires ont été demandés. Ce bilan à montré les résultats suivants : TSHus<0, 05µUI/ml (normale 0, 4-4, 8), T4 Libre>100 pmol/l (normale 9-25). Échographie thyroïdienne : glande thyroïde en situation anatomique, globalement augmentée de volume, sans nodule individualisable ni calcifications. ECG : tachycardie sinusale à 135/min, hypertrophie ventriculaire gauche (HVG) avec indice de Sokolov=60mm. Hémogramme : Globules blancs =10860/mm3 dont 6% de polynucléaires neutrophiles, 61% de lymphocytes, 7, 5% d'éosinophiles soit 810/mm3; Hémoglobine=11, 6g/dl avec un volume gobulaire moyen = 74, 2 fl (anémie microcytaire); plaquettes =383000/mm3. Fonctions rénale et hépatique normales. Glycémie veineuse : 3, 5mmol/l. Le traitement prescrit associait: Carbimazole (Neomercazole*) à la dose de 0, 5mg/kg/j, Propanolol (Avlocardyl*) 0, 5mg/kg/j et un anxiolytique ainsi qu'un déparasitage systématique à l'albendazole à cause de l'hyperéosinophilie. Sous ce traitement l'évolution a été rapidement favorable, malgré le fait que cet enfant présentait une maladie de Basedow plutôt sévère avec une cardiothyréose . Il est actuellement au traitement d'entretien pour 18 mois qui devrait se terminer en Janvier 2018 mais malheureusement les parents ne respectent pas les dates de contrôle.","

En décembre 2012, elle nous a consulté pour fièvre, toux productive, expectorations purulentes et douleurs basi-thoraciques bilatérales. L'examen initial a objectivé une fièvre à 39°c, un pouls à 120 battements/min, une polypnée à 30 cycles/min, des râles crépitants à l'auscultation pulmonaire et un syndrome tétra-pyramidal, le reste de l'examen physique est normal. La gazométrie à montré une hypoxémie à 56 mmHg et une hypocapnie à 28 mmHg. Le reste du bilan biologique est normal hormis une hyperleucocytose à 14 400 éléments par mm3. La radiographie thoracique montre une pneumopathie bilatérale étendue et mal limitée. Dans le doute d'une EP associée, un angioscanner thoracique a été réalisé et a confirmé le diagnostic d'EP en montrant un défect endoluminal lingulaire supérieur et inférieur ainsi que des lésions kystiques diffuses aux deux poumons évoquant une LAM pulmonaire . L'echo-dopler des membres inférieurs n'a pas objectivé de thrombophlébite. L'IRM cérébro-médullaire, à la recherche de méningiome a montré une atrophie cérébrale et médullaire cadrant avec une SEP avec des hypersignaux de la substance blanche de siège péri-ventriculaire et en sous cortical. Le scanner abdomino-pelvien met en évidence un angiomyolipome rénal gauche de 10 x 8 x 6 cm de grand axe . Le diagnostic d'une LAM dans sa forme sporadique est posé devant les anomalies scanographiques et la présence d'angiomyolipome rénal. Le bilan de thrombophilie, réalisé par ailleurs dans le cadre de l'enquête étiologique de l'EP, est négatif. Une héparinothérapie a été instaurée relayée par un traitement par anti-vitamine K de même qu'une antibiothérapie à large spectre, une réhydratation et des séances de kiné respiratoire avec amélioration de l’état respiratoire et de l’état général.","

Une dermatomyosite a été fortement suspectée surtout devant une discrète élévation des enzymes musculaires. Elle a alors été traitée par un médecin de libre pratique par une forte dose de corticothérapie. L’évolution a été marquée par l'aggravation des myalgies et l'apparition d'un déficit musculaire. Elle a été alors hospitalisée dans notre service. A l'examen, elle était apyrétique, elle avait un érythroedème de la face, un déficit de la ceinture pelvienne sans déficit périphérique. L'examen neurologique était normal. A la biologie, elle avait un syndrome inflammatoire et une élévation des enzymes musculaires (CPK, LDH, Aldolase) à une fois et demi la normale. L’électromyogramme était sans anomalies. Les AAN notamment les anti JO1 étaient négatifs. L’échographie cardiaque était normale. Devant l'aggravation sous corticoïdes et la négativité du bilan immunologique, une origine infectieuse a été recherchée. La sérologie de Lyme était positive dans le sang et négative dans le LCR.

A l'examen, on retrouvait une patiente de phototype IV à V, avec quelques tâches hyperpigmentées éparpillées au niveau de la face notamment en regard du front et des sillons nasogéniens . L'indication d'injections de PRP en mésothérapie a été posée dans le but d'améliorer la trophicité cutanée et de redonner un coup d'éclat à la peau. Des séances d'injection de PRP espacées d'un mois ont été programmées, avec à chaque séance un prélèvement de 8 cc de sang de la patiente, qui a été centrifugé à 3400 tours pendant 5 minutes, puis injecté en mésothérapie à l'aide d'une seringue fine (25 gauge), en insistant sur les zones hyperpigmentées. Après la troisième séance, la patiente est revue avec un début de dyschromie prédominant en regard des sillons nasogéniens de façon bilatérale. Une consultation en dermatologie a conclu à un vitiligo non segmentaire débutant . Devant cette évolution, les injections de PRP ont été interrompues et la patiente a démarré un traitement par photothérapie. Après 13 séances réalisées à un rythme de deux séances par semaine, nous avons pu constater une disparition totale des tâches dyschromiques . Néanmoins, un traitement complémentaire par 17 séances supplémentaires reste à prévoir pour assurer un meilleur résultat et éviter une éventuelle récidive.","

L’examen trouve une fièvre à 39, 5°C, une sensibilité de l’hypochondre gauche, et des panaris au niveau de la paume de la main gauche et de la plante du pied gauche ainsi que l’examen cardio-vasculaire trouve un souffle d’IM 2/6. L’examen gynécologique était strictement normal. Devant ce tableau, une échographie abdominale réalisée retrouve une image anéchogène médiosplénique à sommet hilaire et à bords périphériques en faveur d’un infarctus splénique . Dans le cadre du bilan étiologique, une échocardiographie trans-thoracique réalisée révèle une greffe oslérienne (confirmé sur l’échocardiographie trans-oesophagienne) sur la valve mitrale qui est épaissie et remaniée, avec une végétation au niveau de la grande valve et une IM grade II. Des hémocultures ont été réalisées lors des pics fébriles qui étaient revenues positives au staphylocoque doré. La porte d’entrée n’a pas été identifiée. La conduite à tenir initiale fut de réhydrater la patiente avec administration d’antipyrétique et d’une antibiothérapie probabiliste à base de ceftriaxone, qui a été changée par la suite après les résultats de l’hémoculture: bi-antibiothérapie adaptée à la grossesse (flucloxacilline et gentamicine). L’évolution était marquée par la survenue d’un accident vasculaire cérébral ischémique étendu et aggravation de son état neurologique. Toutefois elle a présenté plusieurs complications fatales: une endophtalmie gauche à J+38 de son hospitalisation mise sous traitement antibiotique locale, des infections respiratoires à répétition avec dépendance au respirateur, elle a été trachéotomisée à J+54, elle a avorté à 24 S.A; ensuite à J+100 de son hospitalisation, elle a présenté une thrombose de l’artère fémorale gauche qui a été opérée en urgence avec réalisation d’une embolectomie avec un cathéter à ballonnet de Fogartiy.

CR_FRE_102,French,"Mr M.A âgé de 53 ans, Mauritanien, sans contage tuberculeux connu récent dans son entourage, sans habitudes toxiques et sans exposition professionnelle particulière. Le patient a présenté 3 mois avant son hospitalisation une toux sèche devenant productive sans hémoptysies associée à des douleurs thoraciques diffuses peu intenses et une dyspnée d'effort évoluant dans un contexte de sensations fébriles et d'altération de l'état général. Le patient a été admis au service de pneumologie, l'examen général a retrouvé une Performance Status à 1 sans hippocratisme digital avec à l'examen pleuropulmonaire des râles crépitants bilatéraux. Le reste de l'examen somatique a été sans particularité en dehors d'une adénopathie axillaire gauche de 1 cm/1 cm sans signes inflammatoires, mobile par rapport aux deux plans superficiel et profond. La radiographie du thorax a objectivé de multiples opacités réticulo micronodulaires au niveau des deux champs pulmonaires prédominant au niveau des bases. La tomodensitométrie thoracique a montré un aspect en verre dépoli diffus au niveau des deux champs pulmonaires faisant évoquer une pneumopathie interstitielle diffuse sans adénopathies médiastinales. Devant ce tableau nous avons discuté en premier lieu, sur un terrain d'immunodépression probable, une origine infectieuse notamment une tuberculose pulmonaire, une aspergillose semi invasive ou une infection à germes banals. Une détermination thoracique d'une maladie de système à savoir une sarcoïdose dans sa forme atypique ou une vascularite mais il n'y avait pas de signe d'appel clinique ou radiologique en faveur. En dernier lieu nous avons évoqué une détermination thoracique d'une hémopathie maligne. Vu le contexte endémique de tuberculose dans notre pays, l'urgence était de rechercher le Bacille de Koch (BK) dans les expectorations qui sont revenues négatives. La bronchoscopie souple a objectivé une inflammation de 2ème degré diffuse de tout l'arbre bronchique. Le lavage broncho alvéolaire a montré un liquide inflammatoire à prédominance lymphocytaire (30%), la recherche de BK, de germes banals et d'aspergillus dans le liquide d'aspiration bronchique a été négative. Les biopsies bronchiques ont été en faveur d'un remaniement fibreux et inflammatoire modéré de la muqueuse sans signe de malignité ou d'inflammation spécifique. L'exploration fonctionnelle respiratoire a objectivé un trouble ventilatoire mixte. Sur le plan biologique l'hémogramme a montré une hyperleucocytose à 70000 éléments/ mm3 à prédominance lymphocytaire 53000 élément/mm3, le taux de polynucléaires neutrophiles à 13000 élément/mm3, le taux d'hémoglobine et de plaquette a été normale. La Cytométrie en flux sur le sang périphérique a été en faveur d'un syndrome lymphoprolifératif de type T avec positivité de CD2, CD3, CD4, TCR alpha beta, HLA DR et négativité de CD7, CD8 et CD25. Enfin, la biopsie de l'adénopathie axillaire a montré une localisation ganglionnaire d'un lymphome T. Devant ces éléments, un bilan complémentaire a été demandé: un myélogramme et une tomodensitométrie abdomino pelvienne qui sont revenus normales, le frottis sanguin n'a pas révélé de cellules de Sézary, le taux des lactico-déshydrogénase à 507 UI/L, les sérologies virales de l'hépatite B, C, cytomégalovirus et HIV ont été négatives. Le caryotype médullaire a été normal, la biopsie ostéo médullaire a montré une moelle de richesse normale sans cellules malignes. Devant l'origine subsaharienne du patient, la sérologie HTLV1 a été demandée et qui est revenu positive. Le diagnostic retenu a été une pneumopathie interstitielle diffuse dans le cadre d'une leucémie lymphome à cellules T de l'adulte HTLV1+.

CR_FRE_103,French,"Informations du patient: une patiente âgée de 18 ans, ayant comme antécédant un lymphome de Hodgkin à cellularité mixte stade IV par le poumon traité par chimiothérapie à base du protocole OPPA-COPP complété par radiothérapie. Elle s´est présenté 6 mois après la rémission complète pour un nodule inflammatoire mammaire gauche, sans autres symptômes associés.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen clinique a trouvé un performens status à 0, un nodule mammaire du quadrant supéro-externe de 2cm /2cm, inflammatoire, chaud et douloureux, sans adénopathies périphériques ni autres anomalies associés.
Démarche diagnostique: l´échographie mammaire a objectivé une plage hypoéchogène hétérogène du quadrant supéro-externe gauche avec discrets signes d´inflammation. Deux biopsies successives du nodule, à un mois d´intervalle, ont été en faveur d´un remaniement inflammatoire en poussée avec singes d´abcédation, sans signes de malignité. Devant la suspicion d´abcès mammaire, notre patiente a été mise sous antibiothérapie à double reprises à base d´amoxicilline-acide clavulanique sans amélioration, avec apparition d´une ulcération mammaire d´extension rapidement progressive . Cette lésion mammaire n´est pas spécifique du lymphome de Hodgkin, elle peut se voir dans les autres mastopathies notamment infectieuses et cancéreuses. Dans ce contexte, une 3e biopsie mammaire a été faite qui a révélé la rechute mammaire du lymphome de Hodgkin, avec à l´examen histologique et immunohistochimique: une mastite granulomonateuse, présence de nombreuses cellules tumorales Sternbergoides et typiques Hodgkinienne, CD 15 +, CD 20 +, PAX-5+. Les LDH étaient élevés à 2 fois la normale. La numération sanguine n´a pas montré de particularités à part une anémie microcytaire à 11, 5g/l. la VS ainsi que le taux d´albumine ont été normaux. La TDM-TAP dans le cadre du bilan d´extension a objectivé une localisation mammaire isolée sous forme d´un processus lésionnel mal limité rehaussé de façon hétérogène après injection de produit de contraste. La BOM n´a pas montré d´envahissement médullaire. Le diagnostic de rechute mammaire d´un lymphome de Hodgkin à cellularité mixte groupe haut risque a été posé.
Intervention thérapeutique: la patiente a été incluse dans un protocole de rattrapage à base de ICE (ifosfamide, carboplatine, étoposide), avec autogreffe des SCH envisageable. L´évolution a été marquée par une progression de maladie après 3 lignes thérapeutique (ICE puis DHAP: aracytine, carboplatine, déxaméthasone puis GEMOX: gemcitabine-oxaliplatine ) avec présence au PET scanner d´évaluation après chaque ligne d´un processus mammaire hypermétabolique deauville V. Notre patiente est actuellement sous 4e ligne thérapeutique par le protocole BeGVD (bendamustine – gemcitabine - vinorelbine-doxirubicine). Une autogreffe des cellules souches hématopoïétiques sera réalisée dans le cas où une rémission complète sera obtenue.

CR_FRE_104,French,"Patiente âgée de 50 ans a présenté en juillet 1997 un érythrœdème périorbitaire associé à une altération de l’état général. Elle se plaignait d'arthralgies de type inflammatoire intéressant les grosses articulations et de troubles de la déglutition. L'examen notait un œdème violacé périorbitaire bilatéral et des lésions érythémateuses squameuses au niveau du front, du décolleté, des épaules et des avant-bras. Un déficit musculaire proximal au niveau des ceintures scapulaires et pelviennes coté à 2 au testing musculaire et des myalgies spontanées et à la pression des masses musculaires ont été objectivées. Il existait un syndrome inflammatoire biologique avec une vitesse de sédimentation à 68 mm à la première heure, une fibrinémie à 4, 85 mg/l et une hyperalpha2 globulinémie à 10, 2 g/l. Les enzymes musculaires étaient augmentées: la créatine phosphokinase (CPK) à 1085 UI/L (5 fois la normale), la lacticodéshydrogénase (LDH) à 1036 UI/L, la transaminase glutamo-oxaloacétique (SGOT) à 94 UI/L et la transaminase glutamo-pyruvique (SGPT) à 39 UI/L. Le dosage de l'aldolase n'a pas été pratiqué. Le bilan immunologique révélait des anticorps antinucléaires à 1/800 de type moucheté. Les anticorps anti DNA natif et anti J01 étaient négatifs. L’électromyogramme mettait en évidence une activité de repos à type de fibrillations et de salves pseudomyotoniques témoignant d'une atteinte myogéne. L'examen anatomopathologique d'une biopsie musculaire révélait un tissu musculaire strié constitué de fibres d’épaisseur inégale avec par place des noyaux en chaînettes. Ces fibres étaient altérées avec une clarification floconneuse et une vacuolisation cytoplasmique. Le tissu interstitiel était dépourvu de fibrose ou d'infiltrat inflammatoire. Le diagnostic de dermatomyosite a été retenu. La radiographie du thorax et l’échographie cardiaque étaient sans anomalie. Un bilan exhaustif à la recherche d'une néoplasie associée comportant une échographie abdomino-pelvienne, une échographie cervicale, un scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien, une mammographie, un frottis cervico-vaginal, une fibroscopie digestive et une nasofibroscopie avec des biopsies du cavum était sans anomalie. Les marqueurs tumoraux (ACE, alpha foetoproteine, CA 125 et CA 19-9) étaient négatifs. La patiente a été traitée par de la prédnisone à la dose de 1 mg/kg/j. L’évolution a été favorable aux plans clinique et biologique avec une normalisation des enzymes musculaires au bout de 2 mois de traitement. Les doses de prédnisone ont été diminuées progressivement. Deux ans plus tard, la patiente a présenté une rechute de sa dermatomyosite alors qu'elle était traitée par une dose journalière de 10 mg de prédnisone. L'examen trouvait un érythrœdème en lunette associé à un érythème en bande au niveau des deux mains et des papules de Gottron. Un déficit musculaire des ceintures, des myalgies et une polyarthrite étaient objectivés. Les enzymes musculaires étaient augmentées (CPK = 122 UI/L, LDH = 728 UI/L). La corticothérapie a été augmentée à 1mg/kg/j associée à du méthotrexate à la dose hebdomadaire de 7, 5 mg. L’évolution a été rapidement favorable. Dix huit mois plus tard, alors qu'elle était traitée par 5 mg de prédnisone par jour et 7, 5 mg de méthotrexate par semaine, la patiente s'est plainte de l'apparition de multiples nodules sous cutanés, siégeant aux quatre membres et aux fesses. Ces nodules étaient douloureux, érythémateux, de taille variable et n’évoluant pas vers les différents stades de la biligénie. Il existait une lipoatrophie nette au niveau de chaque élément. L'examen physique notait un discret déficit de la ceinture scapulaire. Il n'existait pas de syndrome inflammatoire biologique ni d’élévation des enzymes musculaires. L'examen anatomopathologique de la biopsie d'un nodule sous cutané révélait l'existence d'un infiltrat inflammatoire polymorphe composé de lymphocytes, de plasmocytes, de cellules épithélioïdes et de cellules géantes macrophagiques, parfois groupés en follicules siégeant au niveau du tissu adipeux hypodermique et des septa fibreux . Les vaisseaux sanguins possédaient une paroi épaissie avec une turgescence des cellules endothéliales. Le diagnostic d'une panniculite associée à une DM a été retenu. Les doses de prédnisone ont été augmentées à 0, 5 mg/kg/j toujours en association avec le MTX. L’évolution était marquée par la persistance des lésions cutanées et l'absence de manifestations cliniques ou biologiques d’évolutivité de la DM. Le rôle du MTX a été suspecté et ce traitement a été arrêté. L’évolution s'est faite vers la disparition des lésions cutanées en 2 mois sans récidive avec un recul actuel de 42 mois.","

CR_FRE_105,French,"Mme A. R âgée de 30 ans, multipare, sans antécédent susceptible et n'ayant jamais reçu de traitement œstroprogestatif. Elle a accouché par les voies naturelles au terme d'une 3ème grossesse normale et menée à terme. Des céphalées posturales diffuses et une ophtalmoplégie hyperalgique associés à des cervicalgies inflammatoires et une fièvre, apparaissaient dans le post-partum immédiat (j4).
L'examen clinique à l'admission retrouvait une patiente fébrile à 39, 7°, consciente et bien orientée dans le temps et dans l'espace. La nuque était raide à la tentative de mobilisation, avec une douleur projetée en regard des deux régions parotidiennes. L'attention était également attirée par une exophtalmie bilatérale, avec un œdème palpébral sans goitre. Le bilan biologique retrouvait une hyperleucocytose à 14900/mm3 à prédominance neutrophile, sans anémie ni thrombopénie, de même qu'un important syndrome inflammatoire (CRP à 230mg/l) et un bilan thyroïdien normal. Tous les prélèvements à visée infectieuse (hémocultures, prélèvement de gorge, ECBU, sérologies des hépatites virales B, C et VIH, de même que les sérologies d'EBV, CMV, Herpes et parvoB19) étaient négatifs, de même que le bilan immunologique (Ac anti-nucléaires, Ac anti-phospholipides). La persistance et l'exacerbation des douleurs et de la fièvre, amenait à la réalisation d'un scanner cérébral sans injection couplé à un scanner cervico-thoraco-abdomino-pelvien avec injection qui étaient respectivement sans anomalies.
A la ponction lombaire, le liquide était clair « eau de roche », avec une très faible céllularité (8 GB/mm3 et 70GR/mm3), une protéinorrachie et une glycorrachie normales, de même qu'une culture stérile et une recherche d'antigènes solubles négative. Le tableau clinique évoluait à j10 vers un tableau d'hypertension intracrânienne associée à un œdème papillaire au fond d’œi1. L'IRM cérébrale ainsi réalisée mettait en évidence, en plus d'un œdème cérébral diffus et une exophtalmie bilatérale grade II, la présence de deux lésions lenticulaires et de la tête du noyau caudé en hypo signal T1 et en hyper signal T2, FLAIR des sinus, droit et longitudinal supérieur prenant le contraste en périphérie après injection de Gadolinium, avec individualisation des thrombus en leur sein et développement d'un important réseau de suppléance . Cet aspect IRM était compatible avec une thrombophlébite cérébrale étendue jusqu'au golfe des jugulaires . Après un bolus IVD de 50UI/kg, un traitement par héparine IV, non fractionnée, était entrepris en continu, à la seringue électrique à la dose de 500 UI/kg/jour (25 000UI/24 h) associée à du Solumédrol en flash de 120 mg/jour pendant trois jours, permettait une amélioration très nette de la symptomatologie dès les 1ères 24 heures. Le fond d’œil s’était normalisé et les signes radiologiques régressaient plus lentement et n’étaient plus constatés à j45.
Un traitement par Anti-vitamine K (Sintrom 4mg) fut prescrit en relais de l'héparinothérapie à j21 pendant 6 mois. La négativité du bilan étiologique faisait ainsi retenir comme seul facteur causal à cette thrombophlébite cérébrale «le post-partum». Le bilan de thrombophilie (protéine C, protéine S, antithrombine III, facteur V de leyden ainsi que la résistance à la protéine C), réalisé 3 semaines après l'arrêt des anticoagulants, ne révélait aucun déficit.","

CR_FRE_106,French,"Une jeune fille de 17 ans, suivie pendant cinq ans pour une éruption non prurigineuse du corps prise en charge pendant 2 ans comme une dermatose bulleuse type dermatite herpetiforme, mise sous disulone sans amélioration. La patiente consultait notre service pour la persistance des lésions laissant place à des cicatrices pigmentées et hypochromiques inesthétiques disséminées à tout le corps. L'examen trouvait une patiente apyrétique en bon état général, l'examen dermatologique trouvait de multiples macules et papules hypochromiques et pigmentées, anetodermiques, des petites érosions et papules surmontées de vésicules et de squames par endroit disséminées à tout le corps, quelques cicatrices varioliformes au niveau du visage et corps, Les muqueuses étaient saines. Les aires ganglionnaires étaient libres et il n'y avait pas d'hépatosplénomégalie. Le bilan biologique était normale except une anémie inflammatoire. La biopsie cutané concluait à un PL chronique au stade cicatriciel avec anétodérmie secondaire en montrant un revêtement épidermique plutôt subatrophique et d'aspect ondulé surmonté d'une couche cornée épaissie et compacte. Les couches basales du corps muqueux de Malpighi présente une pigmentation mélanique de répartition inégale et par places exagérée. Le derme papillaire plutôt fibroedémateux abrite très focalement de discrets manchons lymphocytaires à disposition périvasculaire avec de très rares hématies extravasées . Sur les multiples niveaux de coupe réalisés, on observe très focalement une discrète réaction lichénoïde ponctuelle avec vacuolisation des cellules basales associée à une discrète exocytose à petits lymphocytes . Il n'est pas observé de kératinocyte apoptotique. La coloration à l'Orcéine montre un réseau élastique légèrement réduit au niveau du derme papillaire et du derme réticulaire superficiel. La patiente était mise initialement sous corticothérapie orale à raison de 0, 5mg/kg/jr pendant 1 mois sans nette régression des lésions actives, puis mise sous cycline pendant 6 mois avec raréfaction des poussées .

CR_FRE_108,French,"Monsieur H.M est un patient âgé de 54 ans, tabagique chronique à 25 paquets-années et sevré, a consulté en mai 2017 pour une douleur thoracique et une dyspnée associées à une toux produisant des crachats hémoptoiques en contexte d’altération de l’état général. L’examen physique était sans particularités. Par ailleurs, il n’a pas été retenu une notion de contage tuberculeux. Un scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien a été demandé et a montré un processus tumoral pulmonaire périphérique (7, 5x5x6cm) lobaire moyen et supérieur droit associé à un nodule homolatéral. L’étage abdominal ne présentait pas d’anomalie . Le patient a bénéficié d’une lobectomie supérieure et moyenne droite avec curage ganglionnaire le 26.07.2017.
L’examen anatomopathologique de la pièce opératoire était en faveur d’un sarcome à cellules fusiformes de grade II (synovialosarcome) classé pT3N0Mx avec des limites chirurgicales saines sans emboles vasculaires ni d’engainements péri-nerveux. Une relecture des lames a été faite en faveur du diagnostic de synovialosarcome. Le complément d’immunohistochimie a montré une positivité pour le marqueur anti-EMA et une négativité pour les marqueurs CD34, CD20, PS100 et à l’anti-cytokératine type AE1/AE3. La recherche d’un transcrit de fusion spécifique de la translocation t (X, 18) s’est révélée positive par la technique de FISH.

Elle a présenté des céphalées chroniques évoluant depuis 3 ans avec une macrocranie d'aggravation progressive, sans vomissements ni crises convulsives ni déficit moteur.
Au terme de ces 3 années, elle a présenté de façon rapidement progressive des céphalées intenses, des vomissements, une paraparésie puis des troubles de la conscience, ce qui a motivé une consultation aux urgences chirurgicales pédiatriques trois jours après le début des troubles.
L'examen a trouvé une patiente comateuse avec un score de Glasgow à 4, apyrétique avec macrocranie et mydriase bilatérale réactive. Après mise en condition et intubation de la patiente, une TDM cérébrale a objectivé une énorme image arrondie hypodense fronto-pariétale d'environ 13, 9 sur 11, 6 cm faisant suspecter en premier lieu un kyste hydatique .

Ces lésions cutanées prédominaient dans la région péri-ombilicale, les bras, les cuisse et la région péri aréolaire, sans atteinte des muqueuses . Le diagnostic dermatologique d'un pemphigoïde gestationis a été posé après une biopsie cutanée avec examen en immunofluorescence directe qui montrait un infiltrat éosinophile, un œdème sous-épidermique et des dépôts linéaires d'IgG et de fraction C3 du complément le long de la jonction dermo-épidermique. Ce dernier signe est pathognomonique du pemphigoïde gestationis. L'application de corticoïdes locaux avait permis la régression rapide des lésions cutanées.
À 28 SA, après l'arrêt du traitement local, la patiente avait de nouveau consulté du fait d'une récidive des lésions cutanées de même topographie ce qui à incité une reprise du traitement.

CR_FRE_114,French,"Information de la patiente: patiente âgée de 58 ans, sans antécédents particuliers ni risques notamment cardiovasculaires, qui était traitée depuis 2004 pour un cancer du sein droit.
Résultats cliniques: à l´examen physique on retrouve une performance status à 0, une zone de mastectomie propre, sans autre particularités par ailleurs.
Démarche diagnostique: en 2004 la patiente avait bénéficié d´une mastectomie puis chimiothérapie, radiothérapie et hormonothérapie en adjuvant pour son cancer du sein qui était localisé. En 2008 elle a fait une rechute métastatique agressive au niveau osseux, RH+Her2-. Après réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire la décision a été d´instaurer un traitement à base de Bevacizumab à la dose de 10mg/kg en association avec le Paclitaxel, avec une évaluation tous les trois mois et contrôle de la TA et de la protéinurie avant chaque cure. L´évolution a été très satisfaisante avec une nette amélioration clinique, réponse radiologique presque complète et une bonne tolérance du traitement et donc le traitement a été maintenu sous surveillance.
Au bout de 8 mois de traitement soit 10 cures elle a développé une Hypertension artérielle (HTA) (17/9, 5cmHG), découverte lors de l´examen clinique de routine. Une consultation chez le cardiologue a été faite qui a confirmé l´hypertension artérielle. Ensuite à la 129e cure elle a présenté un syndrome d´anasarque, le bilan biologique fait (Bilan rénal, hépatique entre autres) était normal avec une protéinurie négative. Une consultation et un bilan en cardiologie. Une échographie cardiaque a été réalisée et a révélé une poussée d´insuffisance cardiaque avec FEVG à 25% mais TA normale.
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: lors de la découverte de l´HTA, un traitement a été initié par les inhibiteurs calciques avec stabilisation de la tension artérielle. Ses chiffres tensionnels ont par la suite été fluctuants entre 13/7cmHg et 15/8cmHg. Après survenue de l´ICC aiguё, elle a été mise sous traitement à base de diurétiques, Inhibiteurs calciques, IEC, bétabloquants, ARAII, digitaliques. Sous cette combinaison de molécules l´évolution a été bonne, avec une FEVG de contrôle à 60%. Après la survenue de cette insuffisance cardiaque congestive la décision a été d´arrêter définitivement le Bevacizumab en continuant le traitement hormonal débuté entre temps.

CR_FRE_119,French,"Nous vous rapportons le cas d'un patient âgé de 37 ans admis au service d'urologie des Cliniques Universitaires de Lubumbashi, pour hypogastralgie, remontant à environ une année. La survenue d'une hématurie macroscopique totale en cours suivie de mictalgie depuis deux semaines avait motivé sa consultation. Dans ses antécédents; nous avons relevé la notion de séjour dans une région riveraine (bilharziose), notion d'infection urinaire itérative, pas de contage à la tuberculose, non tabagique, pas de notion des tumeurs des voies urinaires dans la famille. Au complément d'anamnèse; douleur et tuméfaction hypogastrique etaient d'apparition progressive accompagnée d'hématurie en cours; pollakiurie; mictalgie; pas de dysurie; pas de fièvre. A l'examen physique son état général était marqué par l'amaigrissement. L'examen de l'abdomen a révélé une voussure hypogastrique médiane à convexité tournée vers le haut; non sensible; de consistance ferme de surface irrégulière: à la pression de laquelle elle ne donne aucune envie d'uriner; à l'épreuve de 3 verres l'hématurie était totale a renforcement terminale; le toucher pelvien était sans particularité. Le diagnostic de tumeur vésicale a été retenu; confirmé par le scanner abdominal ce dernier avait mis en évidence une volumineuse masse tumorale pelvienne, a priori intra vésicale, de 19 cm de grand axe, et s'accompagnant d'une urétéro-hydronéphrose bilatérale à prépondérance gauche, déjà relativement chronique. Le bilan d'extension semble par contre négatif aux niveaux ganglionnaire, hépatique et osseux. Le bilan hématologique réalisé avait montré, l'Hémoglobine= 6, 4g%, Hématocrite= 21%, Globule rouge= 2 850 000/mm3, Plaquettes= 860 000/mm3, Globule Blanc= 12 680/mm3, Vitesse de Segmentation= 110 mm/h, Temps de Saignement= 2'00"", Temps de coloration= 4'00"", Groupe Sanguin = O Rh+, Formule Leucocytaire: Granulocyte= 69%, Lymphocyte= 20%, Monocyte= 11%, VGM= 74, 2 mm3, TGM Hb = 22, 6pg, CGM Hb= 30, 5%.
L'échographie abdomino-pelvienne avait mis en évidence un foie homogène de volume normal, a contours réguliers, pas de masse aorte. Estomac, pancréas sans particularité. Rate homogène, volume normal. Les deux reins présentent des cavités anéchogènes communicantes à gauche, le bassinet et uretère sont dilatés. Vessie augmentée de volume, présente trois masses solides reliées entre elles par des cloisons ayant des contours irréguliers et ponctués. Les deux antérieures grosses masses portent du bas fond vésical. La postérieure mesure environ 140x87 mm et l'antérieure environ 97x43 mm. Elles présentent des flux vasculaires internes. Prostate difficile à visualiser. Conclusion: carcinomes vésicaux, probables compliqués d'hydronéphrose bilatérale (grade A à droite et B à gauche). Le scanner abdominal a mis en évidence une volumineuse masse tumorale pelvienne, a priori intra vésicale, de 19cm de grand axe, et s'accompagnant d'une urétéro-hydronéphrose bilatérale à prédominance gauche. Déjà relativement chronique. La radiographie du thorax et autres examens n'avaient rien de particulier. Dans un premier temps, nous avions réalisé une tumorectomie vésicale et urétérostomie cutanée bilatérale iliaquetemporaire et avons également pris la masse, une portion de la paroi vésicale antérieure et la portion juxta vésicale de l'uretère pour une analyse anatomo-pathologique. En période post-opératoire, il a été pris en charge par une équipe mixte associant les Réanimateurs et les Chirurgiens. Il avait bénéficié d'une antibiothérapie (ciprofloxacine flacon 500 mg: 2x500 mg pendant 7 jours après antibiogramme) et d'un apport liquidien en perfusion (Sérum Glucosé 10% 1 L pendant 8 heures, Sérum physiologique 1L pendant 8 heures, Sérum Ringer Lactate 1 L pendant 8 heures) et une analgésie (Perfac*: Paracétamol infusion 100 mg S/2x1 infusions en IVD pendant 30 minutes) par voie parentérale, une transfusion de deux unités de sang de poche de 450°C.
Les suites post-opératoires étaient marquées par une récidive de la masse vésicale deux semaines après, accompagnée d'hématurie totale, de douleur hypogastrique et d'insuffisance rénale au sixième jour post-opératoire. La biopsie avait mis en évidence un Carcinome urothelial vésicale invasif. Nous avions obtenu un consentement libre et éclairé après un cunsilling, nous avons préparé le tube digestif (Dulcolax comprimé 5mg peros, lavement évacuateur pendant 5 jours, régime pauvre en résidus. Un bilan préopératoire a été réalisé et nous avons repris le patient. Ce dernier a bénéficié d'une Cystectomie totale et enterocystoplastie iléale de substitution en W de Ghoneim et avec curage ganglionnaire sans evidence d'extension. Nous avons laissé une sonde nasogastrique et une sonde vésicale à 3 voies en place pendant 10 jours. Nous avons également réalisé le bilan sept jours après l'intervention, l'urée est redevenue à 14mg%, créatinine à 0, 60mg%. Eu égard aux résultats, nous l'avions soumis sous nutrition parenterale, on procédait au rinçage de la vessie avec 50°C de sérum physiologique chaque jour pour liberer les mucus produits par la muqueuse iléale, au bout duquel l'ablation de la sonde se faite et le patient uriné seul sans problème. Après la cicatrisation de la plaie, son état général est redevenu bon, nous avons fait un bilan précure et nous l'avons soumis sous chimiothérapie adjuvante (Cisplatine et 5 Fluorouracile) après avis d'oncologue et une vitaminothérapie B12 parentérale 1000mg par mois.","

CR_FRE_120,French,"Il s’agit d’une patiente de 52 ans; sans antécédents pathologiques notables; qui a été admise dans notre formation dans un tableau d’hypercalcémie aigue. L’histoire de sa maladie remontait à deux mois auparavant où elle a présenté une asthénie, des douleurs osseuses diffuses, un syndrome polyurique polydypsique et une constipation le tout évoluant dans un contexte d’altération de l’état général. L’examen clinique retrouvait une masse latéro-cervicale droite indolore de consistance dure mesurant 6cm de diamètre. Le bilan biologique préopératoire avait objectivé une hypercalcémie à 172mg/l, une insuffisance rénale, une hyperparathyroïdie avec un taux de parathormone à 555pg/ml et un syndrome inflammatoire modéré . Le bilan de retentissement de l’hypercalcémie a révélé: sur le plan cardiaque: un raccourcissement de l’espace QT à l’électrocardiogramme, sur le plan rénal: une insuffisance rénale avec microlithiase rénale à l’échographie et sur le plan digestif : une gastrite congestive et une pancréatite stade A. Devant cette hypercalcémie maligne menaçante, un traitement a été instauré, basé sur une hydratation massive par du sérum salé avec administration de diurétiques et de biphosphonates. Une échographie cervicale a objectivé une volumineuse masse parathyroïdienne droite, hypoéchogène hétérogène avec des zones de nécrose et des calcifications, mesurant 67x38x49mm de diamètre et une glande thyroïde siège de 2 nodules polaires inférieurs gauches avec absence d’adénopathies cervicales. La scintigraphie au Tc-99m sestamibi a montré: une fixation parathyroïdienne droite inferieure. La tomodensitométrie cervicale a montré: la présence d’une masse parathyroïdienne droite inferieure mesurant environ 6cm et qui est en contact intime avec la thyroïde, la trachée et le plan para vertébral . Après contrôle du taux de calcémie qui est revenu à 100mg/l. Un traitement chirurgical a été indiqué. Le geste chirurgical a consisté en l’exérèse d’une masse ovoïde jaunâtre retro thyroïdienne droite mesurant environ 6cm de grand axe adhérente au lobe thyroïdien homolatéral et à la trachée. Malignité suspectée le geste chirurgical a été complété par une thyroïdectomie totale et un curage ganglionnaire de la chaine récurrentielle homolatérale . L’étude histologique a décrit: au niveau parathyroïdien: la pièce mesure 6x5x4cm, les coupes analysées ont montré une prolifération tumorale faite de cordons et de massifs, les cellules ont un noyau arrondi à ovoïde légèrement hyperchromatique, le cytoplasme et éosinophile et granulaire, le stroma est grêle et vasculaire. Les recoupes ont montré la présence d’une effraction capsulaire focale et de quelques emboles vasculaires. Le complément immuno-histochimique a montré: l’anti-composanteBcl2: marquage faible et focale des cellules tumorales. L’anti-composante Ki67: faible estimée à 15% . Au niveau thyroïdien: goitre multi-hétero-nodulaire sans signes histologiques de malignité. Au niveau ganglionnaire: absence d’atteinte ganglionnaire N0. Le bilan d’extension: TDM thoraco-abdomino-pelvienne a éliminé l’existence d’une lésion secondaire à distance. Les suites opératoires étaient simples et marquées par une baisse des taux de calcémie et de parathormonémie . Le suivi à 3 mois a révélé l’apparition de poly adénopathies cervicales jugulo-carotidiennes bilatérales et médiatisnales . La TDM thoraco-abdomino-pelvienne a éliminé l’existence d’une lésion secondaire à distance.

L'examen clinique trouvait un patient en bon état général, apyrétique, avec des conjonctives normo colorées. A l'inspection on notait une tuméfaction de la région parotidienne droite avec des signes inflammatoire de la peau en regard . A la palpation, tuméfaction de consistance ferme, mal limitée, douloureuse, non battante, mobile par rapport aux plans superficiel et profond, mesurant environ 6cm de grand axe. La palpation de la région parotidienne controlatérale était sans particularités ainsi que celle des deux régions sous maxillaires. Les aires ganglionnaires cervicales étaient libres. L'examen de la cavité buccale et de l'oropharynx ne montrait pas de pyosialie ni d'hémosialie ni de bombement de la paroi postéro-latérale de l'oropharynx. L'examen ORL complet et l'examen général étaient sans particularités. Une échographie cervico-parotidienne a été demandée et a mis en évidence une glande parotide droite hypertrophiée, d’échostructure hétérogène. Une tomodensitométrie cervico-faciale a montré une glande parotide droite augmentée de taille, de contours irréguliers, infiltrant le tissu graisseux sous cutané en dehors, sans visualisation d'image lithiasique ni de lyse osseuse. Ailleurs, le scanner n'a pas objectivé d'adénopathie cervicale. La cytoponction a révélé une inflammation à cellules polymorphes avec absence de cellules suspectes. Le bilan biologique était normal mis à part une hyperéosinophilie. Cependant la recherche systématique d'une protéinurie est revenue négative. Nous avons décidé de réaliser chez ce patient une paro¬tidectomie total droite avec un examen extemporané . L'exploration chirurgicale a trouvé une glande d'allure inflammatoire. L'examen extemporané était en faveur d'une réaction inflammatoire non spécifique faite essentiellement de lymphocytes, sans signe de malignité. Le patient a bénéficie d'une parotidectomie total droite. Les suites opératoires étaient simples. L’étude anatomopathologique de la pièce a conclue à une maladie de Kimura .","

CR_FRE_123,French,"Il s'agit d'une femme âgée de 39 ans, deuxième geste, deuxième pare, 01enfant vivant, sans antécédent personnel ou familial particulier, qui s'est présentée aux urgences à 32 semaines d'aménorrhée, pour céphalée et douleur abdominal dans un contexte d'altération de l’état générale (amaigrissement, vomissement et asthénie). L'examen initial a retrouvé des œdèmes des membres inférieurs, avec des chiffres de pression artérielle systolique modérément élevée (150/92 mm Hg) et une protéinurie à deux croix.
A l’échographie obstétricale, un retard de croissance a été mis en évidence sans signes de décollement placentaire.
Le bilan biologique a révélé une anémie sévère avec un taux d′hémoglobine à 4.3 g/dl, une thrombopénie à 52 000 /mm3 avec un taux de prothrombine (TP) à 100%, sans cytolyse hépatique ni cholestase associée. La fonction rénale était par ailleurs normale (créatininémie à 74µmol/l).
Devant ce tableau clinico-biologique, le diagnostic d'une pré éclampsie sévère compliquée d'un HELLP syndrome dissocié a été retenu. La patiente a été mise sous l'association sulfate de magnésium – nicardipine. Une césarienne a été pratiquée sous anesthésie générale après une maturation pulmonaire par corticothérapie et une transfusion de 02 culots globulaire. La patiente a été extubée sur table opératoire puis transférée au service de réanimation pour complément de prise en charge. L'accouchement a donné naissance d'un nouveau né en bonne santé (Le score d'Apgar était 7 à 1 minute et 8 à 5 minutes; le poids de naissance 2 kg 800mg).
Le bilan postopératoire a montré une anémie macrocytaire (un taux d'hémoglobine à 5.1 g/dl avec VGM = 103), une thrombopénie à 67.000/mm3 associé à une leucopénie (2000 /mm3) et un taux de globules rouges à 2.54 G/l. par ailleurs, le bilan hépatique, le taux de prothrombine et la fonction rénale ont été normaux.
Devant cette pancytopénie, nous avons réalisé une ponction médullaire avec un myélogramme qui retrouve une moelle riche, avec mégaloblastose. Le dosage de la vitamine B12 et les folates a montré une concentration sérique de vitamine B12 = 126 µg/l (valeurs normales = 200 à 800 µg/l) et la concentration d'acide folique sérique = 2 µmol/l (valeurs normales = 2, 5 à 20 µg/l). Le diagnostic d'une anémie macrocytaire mégaloblastique par carence en Vitamine B12 et/ou en folates a été ainsi retenu. La patiente a été mise sous acide folique 5 mg/jour avec une injection journalière de 1 mg de vitamine B12 en intramusculaire. L’évolution a été marquée par la régression de pancytopénie durant le premier mois du traitement substitutif.","

Le patient a comme antécédents, une diarrhée liquidienne évoluant depuis 4 ans et n′ayant jamais été explorée, ainsi qu′une symptomatologie rhumatologique à type d′arthralgies intermittentes des grosses articulations avec lombalgies. L′examen dermatologique a objectivé de multiples papulo-nodules occupant toute la bordure de la marge anale, ayant tendance à la confluence, tantôt violines lichénoïdes, et tantôt érythémateuses charnues, pseudo-condylomateuses .
L′examen histopathologique n′a objectivé que des remaniements inflammatoires non spécifiques, avec la présence d′une muqueuse de type anale hyperplasique, surmontée par des foyers de parakératose. Le derme sous-jacent est le siège d′un infiltrat inflammatoire essentiellement lymphocytaire. On ne notait pas la présence de koïlocytes, d′infiltrat sous basal lichénien, ou de granulome, et les colorations spéciales à la recherche de dépôts, amyloïdes ou mucineux, sont négatives.
Les explorations morphologiques -anuscopie, rectosigmoïdoscopie et tomodensitométrie abdomino-pelvienne- n′ont pas montré de pathologie proctologique, ou de signes en faveur d′entéropathie inflammatoire chronique. La diarrhée a été mise sur le compte d′une infection parasitaire lors de l′identification de Blastocystis hominis et endolimax nana à l′examen des selles, dont le traitement par métronidazole 1, 5 g/j était sans impact sur le prurit anal.

CR_FRE_129,French,"Mademoiselle A.Z. 23 ans a été vue en consultation le 09/09/2011 pour crises convulsives évoluant depuis plusieurs mois. Ces crises répondaient aux critères diagnostics d'épilepsie. Elle a reçu une prescription de 200mg de Phénobarbital à prendre en une prise vespérale. Elle a été revue le 07/10/2011à la demande de ses parents, et hospitalisée pour des symptômes d'allure psychiatriques (instabilité psychomotrice, agressivité physique importante, logorrhée, obnubilation et désorientation temporospatiale). Ces symptômes n'ont pas été contrôlés par l'adjonction de Diazépam (60 mg par jour). Un traitement antipsychotique (Halopéridol 20 mg et Chlorpromazine 400 mg en deux prises par jour) a été mis en place.

Les muqueuses buccales et nasales étaient érythémato-pustuleuses et celles oculaires très érythémateuses avec larmoiement. L'examen biologique n'a montré qu'une anémie microcytaire hypochrome avec leucopénie. La conduite immédiate a été l'arrêt de tous les traitements antérieurs, la prescription d'une réhydratation (3litres par jour : quels solutés ') et un traitement antibiotique (3g d'Ampicilline) per os pour hypothèses diagnostiques de syndrome infectieux et d'hyperthermie maligne des neuroleptiques. Au 2e jour de l'hospitalisation, le diagnostic de toxidermie médicamenteuse type nécrolyse épidermique toxique ou syndrome de Lyell a été évoqué devant l'apparition de décollements bulleux sur l'ensemble du corps . L'ampicilline a été remplacée par l'Erythromycine (2g par jour) et des soins locaux étaient institués (antiseptique nasale, auriculaire et cutané) en plus de la réhydratation. Au 5e jour du traitement, l'évolution était favorable avec la diminution progressive du suintement cutané, la formation puis la chute des croutes, laissant parfois un tégument érythémateux analogue à celui d'une brulure de 2e degré . Après 15 jours d'hospitalisation la patiente avait quitté l'hôpital avec une prescription de Valproate de sodium 2g en deux prises. Revue 2 semaines après sa sortie, l'examen clinique notait une irritabilité et une hypoacousie.","

CR_FRE_130,French,"Information de la patiente: patiente âgée de 27 ans, habitant en milieu rural qui a consulté pour la prise en charge d´un sein gauche inflammatoire. Elle est paucipare allaitante depuis 7 mois et sans antécédents particuliers. Le début de sa symptomatologie remonterait à 4 mois avant sa consultation et serait marqué par la survenue de façon récurrente d´écoulement mamelonnaire purulent associé à une modification cutanée à type de placards inflammatoires et de multiples fistulisation du sein ayant motivé une application locale d´herbicide. Vu la persistance de la symptomatologie et l´apparition des lésions nodulaires érythémateuses rougeâtres aux membres, la patiente a décidé de consulter dans notre structure pour une prise en charge.
Résultat clinique: l´examen général avait trouvé une patiente apyrétique dans un bon état général. L´examen des seins a trouvé des seins asymétriques avec un sein gauche inflammatoire siège d´une masse lisse irrégulière œdématiée et indolore mesurant 4 cm surmontées par des croûtes et de multiples cicatrices de fistulisation laissant sourdre du pus à la pression avec une adénopathie axillaire homolatérale mobile. Le sein controlatéral était sans particularité. Le reste de l´examen physique a trouvé sur les 02 jambes des plaques érythémateuses inflammatoire rougeâtres, chaude et ovale .
Démarche diagnostique: une mammographie réalisée trouvait une opacité à contours mal définis intéressant le quadrant supéro externe (QSE) et la jonction des quadrants supérieurs (JQS) du sein gauche associée à un épaississement du revêtement cutané en regard du QSE. L´échographie mammaire trouvait une plage hypo échogène hétérogène intéressant le quadrant supéro externe (QSE) et la jonction des quadrants supérieurs (JQS) du sein gauche, associée à un épaississement cutané et une adénopathie axillaire d´allure tumorale nécessitant une confrontation histopathologique ainsi qu´une dilatation canalaire rétro aréolaire gauche à surveiller avec un sein droit sans anomalies décelables. La biopsie de cette plage hypo échogène est revenue en faveur d´une mastopathie fibreuse et la cytoponction de l´adénopathie axillaire homolatérale est revenue en faveur d´une lymphadénite de PIRINGER faisant évoquer une toxoplasmose ou mononucléose infectieuse. Un complément de recherche du génome BK par PCR sur la biopsie de l´adénopathie était revenu négatif. Un prélèvement du pus qui s´écoulait à la pression du sein a été fait et est revenu stérile. Un avis en dermatologie a été réalisée pour les lésions des membres inférieurs et une biopsie cutanée des plaques érythémateuses sur les 2 jambes a été effectué et le résultat histologique était en faveur d´une panniculite à prédominance septale avec des granulomes histiocytaires compatibles avec un érythème noueux. Vu l´apparition de nouvelles lésions au niveau du sein gauche et l´absence de diagnostic expliquant le tableau clinique, une échographie mammaire a été refaite et elle décrivait un aspect échographique en faveur de plusieurs collections au sein gauche avec une adénopathie axillaire homolatérale.
Le dossier de la patiente a été ainsi discuté en réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire et une décision de faire une exérèse chirurgicale de la masse du sein gauche a été prise avec un bilan étiologique plus exhaustif. Une relecture de la biopsie de l´adénopathie axillaire gauche a conclu à une adénite réactionnelle. La patiente a bénéficié d´une tumorectomie du sein gauche au cours de laquelle l´exploration a trouvé du pus enkysté avec une glande mammaire très friable. L´étude histologique de la pièce de tumorectomie trouvait un parenchyme mammaire fait des structures ducto-lobulaires régulières avec un tissu palléal dissocié par des granulomes épithélioïdes et gigantocellulaires centrés par des foyers de nécrose suppurative sans prolifération de tumorale décrivant une mastite granulomateuse avec nécrose suppurée sans prolifération tumorale. Le bilan étiologique était sans particularité. Il était fait de sérologies (VIH, hépatites B, C et de syphilis), de recherche des BK, de recherche des anticorps anticytoplasme des polynucléaires neutrophiles (ANCA), des compléments C3 et C4, d´évaluation de la fonction rénale (urée, créatine et protéinurie) et d´une glycémie à jeun. Le diagnostic final de mastite granulomateuse idiopathique associant un érythème noueux a été retenu.
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: après la réalisation d´une tumorectomie, la patiente a par la suite été mise sous un traitement médical à base de corticoïde par voie orale (prednisone 20mg) pendant 6 semaines et une antibiothérapie à base d´amoxicilline plus acide clavulanique 1g/8 h pendant 21 jours et métronidazole 500mg par 8h pendant 14 jours. La posologie du corticoïde était de 1mg /kg/ jour soit: 60 mg par jour pendant 15 jours, puis 40 mg par jour pendant 15 jours, puis 20 mg par jour pendant 15 autres jours. La patiente bénéficiait d´une surveillance hebdomadaire pendant les 15 premiers jours du traitement puis une surveillance chaque 15 jours jusqu´à l´arrêt du traitement. Au cours de chaque rendez elle bénéficiait d´un examen clinique mammaire évaluant la régression de la symptomatologie. 2 mois après la fin du traitement, on constatait une régression complète de la symptomatologie. L´échographie mammaire de contrôle décrivait une disparition totale des lésions existantes avant le traitement.

CR_FRE_131,French,"Présentation du patient: un nourrisson de sexe féminin, issue d´une grossesse bien suivie, est née à terme par césarienne avec un poids de 3700 g. Elle avait une bonne croissance pondérale et ne présentait auparavant pas de symptomatologie respiratoire ni digestive. A l´âge de 3 mois, elle a été amenée aux urgences de pédiatrie pour dyspnée aiguë. Les parents rapportaient une symptomatologie faite de geignement, pâleur et refus de tétée apparue depuis 48 heures.
Résultats cliniques: l´enfant était apyrétique et pesait 6100 g. Elle était polypnéique à 67 cycles/minute avec des signes de lutte respiratoire marqués. L´auscultation cardio-pulmonaire trouvait une diminution des murmures vésiculaires dans l´hémi thorax gauche avec déplacement des bruits du cœur à droite. L´abdomen était plat. L´enfant a été hospitalisée et mise sous lunettes d´oxygène à haut débit. La radiographie thoracique de face a montré une large clarté de l´hémi champ pulmonaire gauche avec enroulement de la sonde nasogastrique en intrathoracique. Il n´y avait pas d´image de poche à air gastrique en sous-diaphragmatique et le médiastin était dévié vers la droite .
Chronologie: devant l´aggravation de l´état respiratoire avec apparition d´une cyanose et une hypotonie généralisée, elle a été intubée et transférée en milieu de réanimation. Démarche diagnostique: Une tomodensitométrie thoracique a montré l´interruption de la continuité de la coupole diaphragmatique gauche. L´estomac était complètement ascensionné en intrathoracique. Il était volvulé autour de son axe et très distendu responsable d´une bascule médiastinale à droite .
Intervention thérapeutique: l´exploration chirurgicale par voie médiane sus-ombilicale avait confirmé le diagnostic de volvulus gastrique organo-axial secondaire à une hernie diaphragmatique postéro-latérale gauche, de type Bochdalek. L´estomac était en totalité intrathoracique et présentait une bonne vitalité après réduction du volvulus. Des lésions nécrotiques pré-perforatives ont été constatées au niveau du fundus . La rate a été également retrouvée ascensionnée en intrathoracique. Le poumon gauche était hypoplasique. Le traitement a consisté en une dévolvulation gastrique puis réduction complète des viscères herniés et fermeture du défect diaphragmatique. L´absence de malrotation intestinale a été vérifiée avant la fermeture de la paroi.
Suivi et résultats: les suites opératoires ont été simples. L´enfant a été alimentée à J 7 post-opératoire et mise sortante à domicile à dix jours post-opératoires. Les contrôles ultérieurs ont montré une évolution favorable.
Consentement du patient: le consentement éclairé du parent a été obtenu pour utiliser les données iconographiques du patient.","

La patiente souligne une durée exagérée de la grossesse malgré les différentes tentatives daccouchement provoqué, dans des postes de santé et à domicile déjà à partir du 11e mois de gestation et la diminution progressive du volume abdominal. La grossesse na pas été suivie et on na enregistré aucun autre élément particulier dans les antécédents.
A l'examen physique, l’état général conservé, la tension artérielle de 90/50 mmHg, la température de 37.2° C et les conjonctives sont plus ou moins colorées. Labdomen est augmenté de volume, asymétrique avec le fœtus moulé à la paroi abdominale, la hauteur est de 28cm, la présentation transverse et les bruits cardiaques fœtaux à lauscultation sont absents. A l'examen gynécologique, le col est long, postérieur, ramolli et fermé. L'utérus est légèrement augmenté de volume mais dune manière non proportionnelle à l’âge de la grossesse.
L’échographie a montré un utérus augmenté de volume mais vide, un fœtus en présentation transverse dans la cavité péritonéale sans aucun signe de vie. La radiographie sans préparation de l'abdomen n'a pas été demandée en raison de son absence dans la structure. Une laparotomie médiane sous ombilico-suspubienne pratiquée sous anesthésie générale a permis de tomber directement sur le fœtus et ses annexes et nous avons constaté ce qui suit : un sac ovulaire dans la cavité abdominale, adhérant aux annexes utérines gauches, aux anses grêles, à l’épiploon et à la paroi pelvienne latérale droite, un utérus légèrement augmenté de volume, un fœtus fortement masséré avec petit placenta adhérant fortement à la paroi pelvienne latérale droite, une absence quasi-complète de liquide amniotique.","

CR_FRE_135,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d'une jeune femme de 34 ans sans antécédents particuliers et jamais opéréeadmise pourdes douleurs épigastriques atypiques d'installation progressive évoluant depuis 6 mois. Ces douleurs étaient associées à des troubles intermittents du transit mais sans fièvre ni singes d'hémorragie digestive. Par ailleurs il n'y avait pas de notion de prise médicamenteuse ou d'altération de l’état général restant jusque-là conservé. L'examen clinique trouvait une sensibilité épigastrique et une masse palpable au niveau du flanc gauche. Cette masse était indolore, de consistance ferme, mobile par rapport au plan superficiel et fixe par rapport au plan profond. L’échographie abdominale avait objectivé une masse mésentérique faisant évoquer une adénopathie ou une tumeur bénigne de type schwanome. Une tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdominale a été ainsi réalisée pour mieux caractériser cette masse. Elle a objectivé une masse de consistance tissulaire à la racine du mésentère avec une prise de contraste partielle et un liseré de séparation des organes périphériques. Cette masse à contenu hétérogène comportant quelques calcifications refoule les anses intestinales et les vaisseaux mésentériques sans les envahir . En plus, il n'y avait pas de signes de nodules hépatiques ou d'adénopathies profondes. Les marqueurs tumoraux incluant l'alpha-fœto-protéine, l'antigène carcino-embryonnaire et le CA-19.9 étaient dans les limites normales et la fibroscopie œsogastroduodénale demandée dans le contexte d’épigstralgiesétait aussi sans anomalies. Une laparotomie, ainsi indiquée, a été réalisée sous anesthésie générale. L'exploration chirurgicale confirmait l'existence d'une masse d'allure tumorale de localisation mésentérique mais sans aucun contact avec les anses intestinales .
L'exploration du reste de la cavité abdominale n'a pas objectivé de lésions hépatiques ni de carcinose péritonéale. Le geste chirurgical consistait à une exérèse monobloc de la masse sans résection intestinale . La patiente a pu quitter l'hôpital 4 jours après l'intervention chirurgicale sans aucune complication post-opératoire. L’étude anatomopathologique de la pièce opératoire a mis en évidence une masse histologiquement solide mesurant 18x13cm avec une prolifération tumorale constituée de cellules fusiformes . Les limites d'exérèse étaient saines avec un index mitotique estimé à une mitose/50 champs au grossissement x40. A l’étude immunohistochimique les cellules exprimaient seulement l'anti CD117 .

CR_FRE_136,French,"Il s’agit d’un patient âgé de 68 ans, hospitalisé pour exploration de malaises hypoglycémiques récidivants. Il avait comme antécédent personnel une hypertension artérielle depuis 3 ans équilibré sous captopril 50 mg/j. L'histoire de sa maladie remontait à 2 ans marquée par l'installation de malaises survenant à raison de 3 fois par semaine à jeun et en post-prondial, faites de signes adrénergiques (asthénie, sueurs, palpitation) et parfois de signes neuroglycopéniques (céphalées, agitation, perte de connaissance). Ces crises s’amélioraient après resucrage. Une glycémie à jeun demandée était basse à 2.14 mmol/l. Devant la répétition des crises le patient était confié pour exploration et prise en charge.
L’interrogatoire avait éliminé la notion de prise médicamenteuse de toxique hypoglycémiant ou d’alcool. L'examen physique à l’admission trouvait un patient en bon état général. L’indice de masse corporel était à 23 kg/m2. La glycémie au doigt était de 1.12g/l. Il était en euthyroïdie clinique avec thyroïde non palpable et il présentait quelques signes d’insuffisance corticotrope: asthénie qui s’aggrave au cours de la journée associée à un jeun mal toléré à cause des malaises hypoglycémiques. Il avait une dépigmentation des aréoles et une tension artérielle basse à 90/60 mmHg alors que ses chiffres antérieurs étaient élevés. Pour l’axe gonadotrope, il signalait une dysfonction érectile avec baisse de la libido associé à une diminution de la fréquence de rasage et à l’examen il avait une gynécomastie minime unilatérale gauche et des organes génitaux externes types masculins adultes. Le reste de l’examen somatique était sans anomalies.
Sur le plan biologique, il avait une fonction rénale et hépatique normale. Au cours de son hospitalisation, le patient avait présenté deux malaises d’hypoglycémie symptomatiques et les glycémies veineuses concomitantes à ces malaises étaient de 1, 7 mmol/l et de 2, 75 mmol/l. Un dosage de l’insulinémie au moment de ces hypoglycémies était réalisé confirmant l’hyperinsulinisme devant une insulinémie élevée à 27, 2 mUI/l et à 30, 2 mUI/l respectivement. L’indice de Turner (IT) calculé était élevé à 544 au cours du premier malaise et à 151 lors de la deuxième crise hypoglycémique. Le dosage du peptide C lors du premier malaise était élevé à 4, 13μg/l confirmant alors le caractère endogène de l’hyperinsulinisme. Devant ce tableau, on avait éliminé l’hypoglycémie factice par la prise de médicament insulino-sécréteur et les hypoglycémies auto-immunes par la négativité des anticorps anti insuline (Ac anti-insuline < 0, 4 UI/ml). À la recherche d’un insulinome on avait complété par un scanner pancréatique qui était normal. L’écho endoscopie pancréatique n’avait pas été réalisée pour notre patient. Il s’agissait donc d’un tableau d’hypoglycémie organique chez un patient de 68 ans dont l’enquête biologique avait conclu à un hyperinsulinisme endogène avec un diagnostic de localisation qui restait négatif.
Devant la suspicion d’insuffisance corticotrope, un test au synacthène 1μg sur cortisol était pratiqué et avait confirmé l’insuffisance surrénalienne devant l’absence de stimulation de cortisol (T30=177ng/ml et T60=140ng/ml). L’Adreno CorticoTrophic Hormone (ACTH) basse à 9, 3pg/ml confirmait l’origine centrale de l’insuffisance surrénalienne. Le reste de l'hypophysiogramme objectivait un hypogonadisme hypergonadotrope (testostérone: 1, 7ng/ml, FSH: 45mUI/ml, LH: 26, 5mUI/ml). Par ailleurs, l’axe lactotrope, somatotrope et thyréotrope était épargné. L’imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) de la région hypothalamo-hypophysaire n’avait pas montré d’anomalie hypophysaire ni d’atteinte de la tige pituitaire.
L’enquête étiologique de l'hypogonadisme hypergonadotrope était négative: à l’interrogatoire on ne retrouvait pas la notion de traumatisme testiculaire ou d’orchite, également pas de traitement par radiothérapie ou chimiothérapie et pas d’exposition professionnelle à des toxiques. L’échographie testiculaire était sans anomalie et le caryotype avait montrait une formule chromosomique 46, XY. Le patient était traité par hydrocortisone 20mg/j. L’évolution était marquée par la diminution de la fréquence des hypoglycémies devenant très rares et la disparition des signes neuroglycopéniques.
Après 5 ans et devant la réapparition des malaises hypoglycémiques chiffrés à 0, 38 et 0, 5g/l et la perte de conscience le patient était hospitalisé à nouveau au service d’endocrinologie. À l’interrogatoire, on retrouvait une prise de poids de 7Kg en 5 ans dont 3Kg les 2 derniers mois. L'exploration avait confirmé de nouveau l’hyperinsulinisme endogène (glycémie veineuse: 0, 26g/l, insulinémie: 23, 8mUI/l, IT: 595 et peptide C: 4, 48μg/l). Une TDM pancréatique avait mis en évidence une lésion nodulaire bien limitée au niveau du pancréas de Winslow mesurant 16 x 15mm présentant un rehaussement intense et homogène au temps artériel .
L'IRM confirmait l’aspect d'une tumeur neuroendocrine de l'uncus du pancréas avec des multiples lésions hépatiques évoquant des shunts artério-veineux. Le diagnostic d'insulinome de pancréas était retenu et le bilan d'extension était négatif notamment la scintigraphie osseuse. Le patient avait bénéficié sous couverture par hémisuccinate d’hydrocortisone d’une énucléation de la tumeur et une cholécystectomie était aussi pratiquée. L’examen anatomopathologique avait montré un nodule pancréatique de 15 x 12mm dont l’immunohistochimie était fortement positive pour la chromogranine et CD56. Il s’agissait d'une tumeur endocrine bien différencié (grade I selon l'OMS).
L’évolution en post opératoire était marquée par la disparition des malaises hypoglycémiques et une perte de poids de 6kg associée à une normalisation du bilan biologique. En effet, la glycémie à jeun était de 4, 76mmol/l; l’insulinémie à 4.2 mUI/l et un IT à 13, 6. Le test synacthène 1μg était refait à un mois post opératoire objectivant encore l’insuffisance surrénalienne avec une cortisolémie à 103.2ng/ml à 30 minutes et à 98.95ng/ml à 60 minutes. La conduite était de maintenir l’hydrocortisone et on prévoit de répéter ce test à 6 mois après chirurgie.","

L'examen clinique confirme la présence d'un syndrome hémorragique cutanéo-muqueux isolé. Il n'y avait pas de syndrome anémique, tumoral ou infectieux associé. L'hémogramme note une thrombopénie profonde et isolée à 9 Giga/l avec des taux d'hémoglobine et de globules blancs normaux. Le frottis sanguin confirme la réduction du taux des plaquettes sans anomalie morphologique des autres lignées. Le bilan d'hémostase, le bilan hépatique, le dosage des vitamines B9 et B12, les sérologies virales (Hépatite (B, C) et HIV) ainsi que le bilan immunologique (anticorps anti-nucléaire, anti DNA natif et anti-Sm) sont revenu normaux. Le diagnostic d'un purpura thrombopénique immunologique a été retenu et le patient est mis sous traitement corticoïde (bolus de méthyl-prednisolone 15mg/kg/j pendant 3 jours puis relais par prednisone à la dose de 2 mg/kg/j) mais sans réponse.

CR_FRE_141,French,"Un patient de 37 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, admis aux urgences pour traumatisme fermé de la hanche droite à deux heures d'un accident de la voie publique. L'examen clinique à l'admission retrouvait un patient conscient et stable sur les plans hémodynamique et respiratoire avec à l'examen locomoteur, une attitude vicieuse du membre inférieur droit en flexion de la hanche adduction rotation interne sans déficit vasculo- nerveux en distal. La radiographie standard a permis de poser le diagnostic d'une fracture luxation postérieure Pipkin II de la hanche droite, la tête étant indentée sur la paroi postérieure de l'acétabulum . Une tentative de réduction sous anesthésie générale était réalisée à 3 heures du traumatisme, sans succès. Dès lors, nous avons abordé l'articulation par voie postéro latérale: l'exploration avait objectivé une section partielle des muscles pélvi-trochantériens, une tète encochée sur le rebord postérieur du cotyle, avec un fragment céphalique expulsé en postérieur, solidaire au ligament rond. La tête fémorale était difficilement réintégrée à cause d'un effet boutonnière de la capsule, puis soigneusement repositionnée, après trochantérotomie, sur le fragment intra articulaire qui était antéro- inférieur et dont la fixation était obtenue par vissage en rappel au moyen d'une vis canulée 3.5 mm. Nous avons enchainé ensuite par l'ostéosynthèse de la trochantérotomie et la réparation de la brèche capsulaire postérieure. Le patient a été mis sous traction trans tibiale pendant 3 semaines.

"
CR_FRE_142,French,"Le premier patient est un homme de 53 ans, un père de famille qui exerce le métier de maçon. Il ne présente pas d'antécédents pathologiques personnels ou familiaux particuliers. Il consulte en psychiatrie à l'occasion d'une décompensation dépressive, se disant épuisé par la lutte contre un insecte qui infeste son corps depuis presque sept ans. Se déplaçant exclusivement au niveau de son hémicorps droit, l'insecte se frayerait un chemin sous sa peau en la mordant, ce qui engendre une douleur et un prurit intenses. Il rapporte que le trouble a débuté de façon insidieuse et s'est aggravé progressivement jusqu’à atteindre son paroxysme au terme de quelques semaines d’évolution. La revue de la trajectoire du malade met en évidence d'innombrables consultations chez des médecins somaticiens, essentiellement des dermatologues ou des neurologues. Le trouble a entrainé chez lui une altération conséquente sur le plan professionnel puisqu'il s'est retrouvé sans emploi depuis un an. Cependant le patient garde un assez bon fonctionnement familial et social. C'est d'ailleurs sur le conseil d'un ami qu'il consulte en psychiatrie, précisant bien qu'il cherche à soigner sa dépression et réfutant tout droit du psychiatre à traiter son problème « somatique ».
La première évaluation clinique avait permis de découvrir un patient très anxieux, avec une pensée qui demeurait centrée sur une idée délirante unique: « l'insecte qui infeste son corps ». Le patient affirme pourvoir sentir ses mouvements sous son doigt quand il tente de le bloquer et dit même être capable de le déplacer sous sa peau en lui faisant emprunter de longs trajets le long de son dos, en passant par sa nuque jusqu'au visage. Il se déshabille spontanément pour apporter les preuves au médecin, pointant du doigt des endroits correspondant à des lésions de grattages avec des petites cicatrices qu'il attribue aux points d'introduction d'une aiguille dont il se serait aidé pour tenter d'extraire le fameux insecte . Il n'hésite pas à demander au médecin psychiatre de toucher lui même ses endroits, afin qu'il puisse vérifier la véracité de ses dires et sentir les mouvements de l'insecte. D'ailleurs il exprime sa révolte contre l'impuissance voire l'incompétence de certains praticiens et tolère très mal l'incrédulité dont certains ont fait preuve. Par ailleurs, l’évaluation a permis de retenir un syndrome dépressif d'apparition récente, sans idées suicidaires, de ruine ou d'incurabilité comme en témoigne d'ailleurs la perpétuelle quête de soins du patient. Sur le plan perceptif, en dehors de la composante tactile ou cénesthésique qui sous-tend sa conviction délirante on n'a pas retrouvé d'autres éléments hallucinatoires. Il en va de même pour le mécanisme interprétatif, quasi-absent du discours du patient. Les entretiens suivants ont révélé l'importance de la dimension anxieuse chez ce patient. Outre sa réticence à prendre des psychotropes prescrits, il n'hésitait pas à lire les prospectus, rapportant des effets secondaires avec une fréquence très exagérée. L'alliance thérapeutique était très délicate, et ne fut maintenue que grâce à la batterie d'examens paracliniques que l’équipe soignante lui a fait faire à la recherche d'une étiologie organique à son trouble.
Le bilan neurocognitif et les explorations biologiques multiples, dont une biopsie cutanée, n'ont pas révélé d'anomalies notables en dehors de calcifications bilatérales non spécifiques des noyaux gris centraux à l'IRM cérébrale. Au terme de ces investigations exhaustives, le diagnostic d'une hypochondrie ou d'un trouble délirant type somatique ont été discutés. La conviction délirante inébranlable nous a fait retenir le diagnostic d'un syndrome d'Ekbom primaire, correspondant au diagnostic DSM IV-TR au trouble délirant type somatique à thématique d'infestation parasitaire, compliqué d'un épisode dépressif caractérisé. Après une tentative non concluante de traitement par Olanzapine pendant 6 semaines (10mg/ jour), une atténuation significative du délire a été obtenue sous Halopéridol (12mg /j) au bout d'un mois de traitement. Par ailleurs, l’épisode dépressif a été jugulé par un traitement à base de Venlafaxine (75mg / jour).","

La symptomatologie n’a pas été accompagné de fièvre ni de manifestations allergiques. Il n´y avait aucune anomalie à l´examen systémique notamment l’hygiène bucco-dentaire était satisfaisante. L’examen local révèle une lèvre inférieure augmentée de volume avec des fissures. La surface de la muqueuse est oedémaciée. Le gonflement est étendu à la lèvre supérieure. La commissure labiale gauche est ulcérée. La muqueuse nasale, le plancher de la gorge et la langue étaient normaux. Ces lésions sont rebelles à tout traitement antibiotique ou antihistaminique.

CR_FRE_147,French,"Un homme âgé de 38 ans, pesant 72kg pour une taille de 173cm, déjà opéré à l’âge de 34 ans pour un kyste hydatique du foie, était programmé pour une cure chirurgicale de 3 kystes hydatiques du foie, diagnostiqué par échographie abdominale. C'est un patient sans antécédents pathologiques notables, en particulier allergiques. L'examen clinique préopératoire était normal, en dehors d'une hépatomégalie. Les examens préopératoires étaient normaux en dehors d'une sérologie hydatique positive. Le patient était classé ASA I (selon la classification de l'American Society of Anesthesiology).
La prémédication consistait en la prise de l'hydroxyzine 1mg/kg par voie orale le matin de l'intervention. Après une antibioprophylaxie par 2g d'association amoxicilline + acide clavulanique, l'anesthésie était induite par du propofol 3mg/kg, du fentanyl 3μg/kg et du bromure de rocuronium 0, 5mg/kg. L'anesthésie était entretenue avec de l'isoflurane véhiculé par un mélange équimolaire d'oxygène et de protoxyde d'azote et par fentanyl en injections discontinues. Il n'y a pas eu de réinjections de curare. Le geste chirurgical devait associer aspiration du contenu kystique et résection des dômes saillants, complétés par un lavage des résidus kystiques par du sérum salé hypertonique. Quinze minutes après l'ouverture du troisième kyste (105 min après l'induction et 40min après la dernière réinjection du fentanyl), une tachycardie (136 b/mn) apparaissait, suivie d'une diminution de la pression artérielle systolique à 97, puis à 63 mm Hg, associée à une nette augmentation des pressions d'insufflation, à une désaturation en oxygène (72%), à la perception de râles sibilants au niveau des deux champs pulmonaires et apparition d'un érythème au niveau de la partie supérieure du thorax et du cou. Ce tableau était évocateur d'un choc anaphylactique avec bronchospasme. Le patient a été immédiatement mis sous 100% d'oxygène en ventilation manuelle, arrêt de l'isoflurane, simultanément, l'adrénaline à la dose de 0, 2mg, l'hydrocortisone à la dose de 200mg sont administrées par voie intraveineuse, de même qu'un remplissage vasculaire rapide par du sérum salé 0, 9% à la dose de 25ml/kg est démarré. Malgré ce traitement symptomatique, l’évolution était marquée par une aggravation immédiate avec la survenue d'un arrêt cardiaque. Celui-ci est récupéré après 5 minutes de massage cardiaque externe et administration intraveineuse de 1 mg d'adrénaline à deux reprises.
Après un lavage péritonéal abondant, mise en place d'une voie veineuse centrale (veine jugulaire interne droite), le patient est transporté en service de réanimation, intubé, sous ventilation mécanique. En postopératoire, il a été mis sous hydrocortisone à la dose de 100mg toutes les 6 heures, avec de l'adrénaline à la dose de 0, 1μg/kg/mn en perfusion continue. L’évolution était favorable, avec levée du bronchospasme et stabilisation de l’état hémodynamique. Cela a permis d'extuber le patient après 24 heures, et de le sevrer progressivement de l'adrénaline, les corticoïdes ont été maintenues pendant 72 heures, et il a été transférer dans le service de chirurgie générale après quatre jours. Les suites étaient favorables et le patient rejoignait son domicile à j12.","

Cette symptomatologie avait poussé la patiente à consulter chez un dermatologue et une biopsie cutanée était réalisée qui était en faveur d'une dermite granulomateuse. Dans le cadre du bilan de la sarcoïdose on avait réalisé une radiographie thoracique qui avait objectivé un syndrome réticulo-micronodulaire intéressant les deux hémi-champs thoraciques. Le complément TDM thoraco-abdominale avait objectivé une adénomégalie thoracique associée à une atteinte interstitielle de type lymphatique et à une splénomégalie nodulaire (stade II). L'exploration fonctionnelle respiratoire n'a pas objectivé de syndrome restrictif alors que la DLCO était diminuée à 74%.

CR_FRE_154,French,"Un homme de 56 ans, chauffeur de profession, se présentait à notre consultation pour avis cardiologique. Il est connu comme porteur d’une cardiomyopathie dilaté (CMD) à coronaires saines, avec fraction d’éjection abaissée, ayant présenté plusieurs épisodes d’insuffisance cardiaque. Ce dernier a bénéficié en 2012 de l’implantation d’un DAI monochambre de marque Saint Jude Médical, pour des arythmies ventriculaires. Depuis un mois (novembre 2014), il signale des épisodes itératifs de décharges électriques délivrées par le DAI, épisodes inquiétants, angoissants, sans sensation de palpitations. Dans ses antécédents, on ne note rien de particulier, et il ne présente aucun facteur de risque cardiovasculaire. Le traitement d’entretien associe du furosémide per os, du périndopril, et de l’acénocoumarol. L’examen clinique du 05/12/2015 notait un patient en surpoids (IMC = 29, 7 kg/m2), paucisymptomatique en classe fonctionnelle NYHA I-II, apyrétique. La pression artérielle était symétrique à 107/68 mmHg, pour une fréquence cardiaque à 108 bpm. Les bruits du cœur étaient assez réguliers, entrecoupés de quelques extrasystoles, sans signe d’insuffisance cardiaque. Les pouls périphériques proximaux et distaux étaient présents et symétriques. L’auscultation pleuropulmonaire était normale.
L’électrocardiogramme de repos s’inscrivait en rythme sinusale, FC = 111 cpm, aspect de bloc incomplet gauche, avec des extrasystoles ventriculaires isolées. L’interrogation du DAI par un programmateur MERLIN a objectivé 12 épisodes d’arythmies ventriculaires à type de tachycardie et de fibrillation ventriculaires, ayant nécessité des traitements par ATP (antitachycardiapacing) et par des chocs de 15 joules. Devant cette urgence, l’adjonction d’un traitement anti-arythmique a été initiée, associant de l’amiodarone per os à la dose de charge, et un bêtabloquant. L’échocardiographie transthoracique a mis en évidence un aspect de CMD hypokinétique avec altération de la fonction systolique du VG (FE = 30%). Le Holter ECG des 24 heures a objectivé de nombreuses extrasystoles ventriculaires, parfois bigéminées, avec un épisode de tachycardie ventriculaire soutenue, ayant nécessité un choc signalé par la patient. L’évolution à H24 était assez favorable, le patient décrivant un léger mieux, avec une première nuit calme depuis plusieurs jours. Nous avions recommandé la poursuite du traitement associant furosémide, périndopril, amiodarone, nébivolol, et acénocoumarol. Le patient a été revu un mois après, signalant un mieux être et une reprise d’activités professionnelles. L’interrogation du DAI n’a pas objectivé d’événements rythmiques récents, et le Holter ECG dans les limites de la normale. Le traitement en cours a été reconduit et optimisé, la condition clinique et hémodynamique du patient restant stable avec un recul de trois mois.","

A, âgé de 20 ans, admis aux urgences pour dyspnée avec sepsis suite à un traumatisme pénétrant thoraco-abdominal par éclats de balle accidentel, avec hémo-pneumothorax droit drainé sept jours avant. L’examen clinique à l’admission trouvait un patient polypneique, fébrile à 39° C, un pouls à 114 battements/min et une tension artérielle de 90/60 mmHg. A l’inspection on a noté la présence de deux cicatrices de l’hémi thorax droit dont l’une correspondait à la plaie thoracique suturée et à l’autre à l’orifice de drainage thoracique. On a noté une défense de l’hypochondre droit et des signes d’épanchement pleural liquidien droits consécutivement à l’examen abdominal et pleuro pulmonaire. La radiographie thoracique objectivait les éclats de plomb avec un épanchement pleural mixte. La tomodensitométrie thoraco-abdominale a mis en évidence une contusion hépatique avec collection inter hépato diaphragmatique, associée à un hydro pneumothorax droit . Un drainage thoracique a été effectué, il a ramené un litre de bile, stérile à l’examen bactériologique.
Le bilan biologique a permis de noter une hyperleucocytose à 21300/mm3, une hémoglobine à 8.5g/dl ayant nécessité une transfusion sanguine avec une CRP élevée.
Le patient a été opéré, une laparotomie médiane a été réalisée, mettant en évidence une zone de contusion du dôme hépatique avec collection biliaire en inter hépato phrénique, communiquant avec la plèvre droite par un trajet fistuleux. Le geste chirurgical a consisté en une déconnexion hépato diaphragmatique, mise à plat de la collection biliaire inter hépato diaphragmatique et du trajet fistuleux, avec drainage externe de la collection par des lames de DELBET, vu la fuite biliaire importante et l’impossibilité de l’aveuglement des fistules biliaires au niveau de la zone contuse et phrénoplastie. En post opératoire, le drainage pleural et abdominal ramenait 200 ml de bile quotidiennement, puis s’est tari progressivement. Le patient est déclaré sortant après une hospitalisation de 21 jours. Le patient revu trois mois après en consultation, le contrôle clinique et radiologique étaient satisfaisants.","

CR_FRE_156,French,Il s’agit d’une patiente de 56 ans ayant comme antécédent une tuberculose pleurale traitée en 2013. La symptomatologie remonte à 6 mois par l’installation d’une hémoptysie de faible abondance évoluant dans un contexte d’altération de l’état général. L’examen clinique à l’admission a révélé une adénopathie axillaire droite inflammatoire non fistulisée. La radiographie du thorax a montré des opacités micronodulaires et nodulaires bilatérales confluentes par endroit dont certaines sont calcifiés avec attraction de la trachée et coiffe pleurale bilatérale. La recherche de BAAR dans les expectorations est revenue positive à l’examen direct (ED) et le Genexpert a détecté le MT avec résistance à la rifampicine. Le test GenoType MTBDRplus a montré une résistance de haut niveau à la rifampicine et à l’isoniazide. Le test GenoType MTBDRplus a montré une résistance de haut niveau à l’ofloxacine et était sensible à la kanamycine et à l’amikacine. Une cytoponction de l’adénopathie a été réalisée et la culture a mis en évidence des BAAR. Le bilan biologique et la sérologie VIH était normaux.

CR_FRE_157,French,"Il s'agit d'une enfant caucasienne, âgée de neuf ans, issue d'un mariage consanguin, et deuxième d'une fratrie de trois, qui présente une pachyonychie des ongles des dix doigts et des dix orteils, une kératose douloureuse des membres, et une kératose du tronc, découverte pendant la première année de vie . Dans ses antécédents, on note des broncho-alvéolites à répétition dès l'âge de sept mois, et une invagination intestinale à l'âge de dix-huit mois traitée par une insufflation. A l'âge de huit ans, elle avait présenté une insuffisance cardiaque globale avec une hypertension artérielle sévère. Le bilan cardiaque avait objectivé une cardiomyopathie dilatée hypertensive, et le bilan étiologique de l'hypertension artérielle (HTA) avait révélé une sténose de l'artère rénale gauche au niveau ostial avec une absence totale de parenchyme rénal gauche fonctionnel, Justifiant une néphrectomie. Aucune cause de la sténose de l'artère rénale n'était retrouvée chez notre patiente. Trois années plus tard, la patiente avait présenté une hypertrophie compensatrice du rein controlatéral avec une protéinurie néphrotique dans un contexte d'HTA. L'enfant était mise sous inhibiteurs de l'enzyme de conversion (IEC) à la dose quotidienne de cinq milligrammes, associés à un inhibiteur calcique à dix milligrammes par jour, avec un bon équilibre des chiffres tensionnels et une diminution de la protéinurie. A l'admission dans notre structure, à l'âge de neuf ans, l'examen clinique de la patiente avait objectivé, outre l'HTA, un épaississement des ongles et des orteils, une leucokératose de la langue, une hyperhidrose palmo-plantaire ainsi que des folliculites kératosiques au niveau du tronc. L'ensemble de ces lésions serait apparu à l'âge de trois mois selon la mère de l'enfant. Cependant, la patiente n'était pas suivie pour ces anomalies. Par ailleurs, l'examen n'avait pas montré de formations kystiques, ni de lésions évidentes au niveau capillaire, oculaire ou dentaire. De plus, les examens spécialisés ORL et ophtalmologique étaient sans particularités. L'enfant avait également bénéficié d'un examen mycologique, qui était négatif, ainsi que d'une biopsie unguéale dont le résultat était en faveur d'un épaississement unguéal avec une hyperplasie malpighienne concordant avec le diagnostic d'une pachyonychie congénitale. Compte tenu de ces différentes données et notamment de la présentation clinique, Il s'agit probablement d'une pachyonychie congénitale type I. En l'absence d'un traitement curatif, L'enfant avait reçu une médication à usage local à base de dérivés de la vitamine A, à savoir l'Acitrétine, à la dose de 10 mg/j pendant un mois. La patiente avait présenté une bonne tolérance du traitement et une amélioration de l'hyperkératose palmo-plantaire. Cependant, elle n'avait pas bénéficié de l'exérèse de la matrice unguéale, étant donné que la longueur et l'aspect des ongles, ne justifiaient pas ce geste. En outre, l'enfant continuait à présenter des infections bronchiques à répétition, sans organomégalie ni polyadénopathie, ni retard staturo-pondéral. Un déficit immunitaire était écarté devant la normalité de la numération sanguine et le dosage pondéral des immunoglobulines. Un scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien, en revanche, avait montré une dilatation des bronches localisée au niveau des lobes inférieurs bilatéraux, sans autres anomalies associées. La patiente est traitée régulièrement par des séances de kinésithérapie respiratoire et une antibiothérapie lors des épisodes de surinfection bactérienne.","

CR_FRE_160,French,"Madame K.L. âgée de 75 ans, autonome, ayant comme antécédents une artériopathie carotidienne droite et opérée pour un goitre thyroïdien et substituée par Lévothyrox 75 mcg/ jour. En septembre 2010, elle a été victime d’une Chute occasionnant chez elle un traumatisme crânien bénin sans perte de connaissance, restée sans suites. Et depuis les chutes se succèdent, un scanner cérébral a été réalisé qui a montré une hydrocéphalie tétraventriculaire avec signes de résorption transépendymaire, le diagnostic de l’hydrocéphalie chronique a été suspectée, une ponction lombaire déplétive et analyse de liquide cérébrospinal était en faveur d’une hyper-protéinorachie à 3, 23 g /dl et la pression était de 14cmH2O. Elle se présentait début janvier 2011 avec une confusion et désorientation temporo-spatiale, une marche extrêmement difficile nécessitant l’aide de deux personnes et des troubles mnésiques majeurs reconnaissant à peine ses enfants. La patiente rapportait également la notion des dorso-lombalgies avec irradiation dans le membre inferieur gauche. L’examen clinique n’objectivait pas de déficit moteur, par contre il existait un signe de Babinski et le reflexe rotulien était vifs au membre inferieur gauche. Toute cette symptomatologie nous a fait d’emblée évoquer la possibilité d’une tumeur médullaire responsable d’hydrocéphalie. Une IRM cérébrospinale en pondération T1, T2 et T1 avec injection de gadolinium montrait à l’étage encéphalique une hydrocéphalie communicante avec résorption trans-épendymaire sans signes demétastases leptoméningées . À l’étage médullaire, il existaitune lésion intra durale extra médullaire siégeant en regard de la vertèbre D12 paramédiane gauche responsable d’une importante compression médullaire. La lésion est spontanément hypointense T1 et hyperintense T2 et qui se rehausse de façon intense et hétérogène . Nous avons décidé d’intervenir sur la lésion médullaire dont le niveau lésionnel nous a incité à compléter par une artériographie médullaire, cela nous a permis de repérer l’artère d’Adamkiewicz qui naissait en D12 gauche . L’intervention chirurgicale a permis une exérèse complète. L’examen anatomopathologique montrait une prolifération tumorale à cellules fusiformes sans signes de malignité évoquant un schwannome. L’évolution a été lentement favorable chez cette patiente qu’on a pu recommencé à mobiliser progressivement, la mise au fauteuil a pu se faire rapidement sans problème puis la marche a pu se faire d’abord avec deux aides, puis progressivement avec un déambulateur et l’aide d’un kinésithérapeute. Sur le plan cognitif on a constaté assez rapidement une amélioration de la vigilance et une amélioration lente des troubles mnésiques avec disparition complète au bout de 6 mois d’évolution. La protéinorachie a nettement baissé à 0, 29g/L et le scanner cérébral de contrôle réalisé à 6 mois montrait une régression de la dilatation ventriculaire .","

CR_FRE_167,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d'un patient, de sexe masculin, policier de fonction, albinos, âgé de 36 ans, venu consulter aux cliniques universitaires de Lubumbashi en date du 30/10/2018 pour une solution de continuité au niveau du bras gauche et une tuméfaction au niveau du cou. La symptomatologie remonterait à 7 ans de la présente consultation (soit en octobre 2011) par l'apparition spontanée d'un nodule au niveau du bras gauche qui, progressivement, prenait de plus en plus de volume au cours des années. Le nodule s'ulcéra au bout de la quatrième année après son apparition (en juin 2015). Le patient consulta pour la première fois un centre médical de la ville seulement après l'apparition de l'ulcération du nodule bras (en juin 2015) où une exérèse de la masse suivie des pansements à la solution de Carrel a été réalisée pendant 4 mois. L'examen anatomopathologique de la masse prélevée n'avait encore jamais été réalisé. Le patient déclare que la cicatrisation complète de la plaie opératoire n'a jamais eu lieu. L'incapacité financière du malade à poursuivre les soins médicaux l'oblige à interrompre le traitement pendant 14 mois et à recourir à la médecine tradi-moderne mais sans aucun succès. La réapparition de la masse devenant ulcéreuse et beaucoup plus large le pousse à consulter à nouveau un second centre médical de la place où le pansement local à la solution de carrel a été conduit auquel une antibiothérapie fait de Ceftriaxone injectable 3 x 1 g/j a été instauré mais sans succès au bout de 6 mois de traitement. A nouveau, le traitement a été interrompu par le patient faute de moyens financiers pendant 12 mois.
L'aggravation et même l'extension de la lésion malgré le traitement le pousse à consulter à nouveau un troisième central médical où des pansements au sérum physiologique ont été réalisés pendant 6 mois et de l'Amoxicilline gélules 500 mg à raison de 3 x 1 g/j lui a été administré pendant 4 mois sans succès. L'apparition de la douleur, de l'impotence fonctionnelle du membre supérieur gauche et l'exacerbation de l'ulcération motive le patient à consulter les cliniques universitaires de Lubumbashi pour une meilleure prise en charge. Aux antécédents, c'est un patient né septième d'une fratrie de 13 enfants dont deux albinos, notre patient ainsi que le onzième de la famille. Il ne prend pas l'alcool mais se reconnait fumeur occasionnel. Aucune notion de transfusion notée, n'a pas d'antécédent chirurgical particulier. Il est marié et est père de 6 enfants tous en vie et en bonne santé apparente. Au complément d'anamnèse, le patient signale l'apparition spontanée il y a six mois d'une seconde tuméfaction à la face postérieure du cou, légèrement douloureuse, suintant; une lourdeur du membre supérieur gauche depuis environ 2 ans devenue importante depuis 6 mois. Pas de toux, pas de fièvre. A notre examen physique, l'état général est marqué par une impotence fonctionnelle du membre supérieur gauche et un amaigrissement important (poids actuel: 51 kg; dernier poids connu mentionné par le patient était 64 kg remonte à 4 ans avant).
Les signes vitaux à l'admission sont 150/74 mmHg pour la tension artérielle, 110 battements par minutes pour la fréquence cardiaque, 28 cycles par minute pour la fréquence respiratoire et 36, 8° pour la température. A l'examen de la tête et du cou, nous avons noté une pâleur des conjonctives palpébrales, des conjonctives bulbaires anictériques. A la face postérieure du cou, une tuméfaction médiane cervico-dorsale en regard de la sixième vertèbre cervicale à la deuxième vertèbre dorsale, bourgeonnante et ulcérée, de forme ovoïde, grand axe longitudinal 10cm et petit axe transversal 5cm, de consistance ferme, mobilisable, non adhérant au plan profond et laissant sourdre du pus, peu sensible . Tous les mouvements de la colonne cervicale ne sont pas perturbés. Le thorax est symétrique, de bonnes ampliations respiratoires, les bruits cardiaques réguliers. Les vibrations vocales sont bien transmises, sonorité pulmonaire normale à la percussion et à l'auscultation le murmure vésiculaire est pur. L'abdomen est non ballonné, souple, dépressible et sans aucune viscéromégalie palpée.
L'examen du membre supérieur gauche révèle une large solution de continuité ulcéro-bourgeonnante, prenant la face postéro-latérale du bras gauche, en dessous de l'épaule dont la limite supérieure est située à 10cm en dessous de l'acromion jusqu'au coude, creusant en profondeur, laissant l'humérus à nu avec une fracture localisée au tiers moyen du bras; cette solution de continuité est sensible, saignant au contact et laissant sourdre des sécrétions verdâtres . Pas d'adénopathie perçue ni épitrochléenne, ni axillaire. Le membre est légèrement œdématié, par rapport à celui controlatéral. L'examen vasculo-nerveux du membre supérieur gauche fait état d'une impotence fonctionnelle, d'une motricité diminuée côté à 3/5 selon la cotation de la motricité par Merle d'Aubigné, l'extension active du poignet est impossible, la sensibilité est conservée à tous les modes, le pouls radial est difficile à percevoir à cause de l’œdème mais le pouls capillaire est présent et de moins de 2 secondes, la saturation en oxygène pris au pouce est de 96%. A l'issue de l'examen clinique, les diagnostics retenus étaient: carcinome basocellulaire térébrant ou spinocellulaire du bras gauche compliqué d'infection et de fracture pathologique de l'humérus avec atteinte du nerf radial, carcinome spinocellulaire ou basocellulaire de la face postérieure du cou ulcérée et l'anémie chronique à investiguer.
Une hospitalisation a été réalisée et des bilans paracliniques demandés que voici: la radiographie du bras gauche face et profil qui a montré une fracture de l'humérus avec une perte de substance importante . Un bilan d'extension fait d'une radiographie du thorax et d'une échographie abdominale a été réalisé mais était tout à fait normale. Un bilan hématologique fait d'hémoglobine Hgb (4 g%), hématocrite (14%), groupe sanguin et rhésus (O+), temps de saignement (2 minutes 30 secondes), temps de coagulation (6 minutes), le test de sérologie rapide au HIV (négative). Un typage de l'anémie avant transfusion a été réalisé et a donné comme résultat: réticulocytes 4%, volume corpusculaire moyen (MCV) 82 fL, teneur corpusculaire moyenne en hémoglobine (MCH) 30 pg, concentration corpusculaire moyenne en hémoglobine (MCHC) 330 g/l. Ensuite un bilan inflammatoire réalisé a donné comme résultat: GB: 4200/mm3, VS: 103 mm à la 1ère heure, FL: L62% N38% M0% E1%. Il s'agissait donc d'une anémie régénérative d'origine périphérique. Quatre unités de sang de 450cc iso-groupe, iso-rhésus testés et compatible ont été administré. Une culture des secrétions verdâtre a été faite et a isolé des pyocyaniques; la solution boriquée a été indiquée pour le pansement biquotidien. La bithérapie antibiothérapique faite de Céfotaxime flacon 3 x 2 g/j et métronidazole infusion 3 x 500 mg/j a été instaurée; le tramadol ampoule 2 x 100 mg/j; le sérum anti-tétanique (3000 UI en sous-cutané après test de Besredka), le supplément martial fait de Hifer comprimé 2 x 1 cp/j. Deux prélèvements biopsiques ont été réalisés; le premier au niveau de la masse ulcéro-bourgeonnante du cou et le second au niveau de la masse ulcéro-bourgeonnante du bras avaient été réalisé en date du 19/12/2018.
Les résultats d'examen anatomopathologie ont montré une prolifération cellulaire indubitablement maligne. Les cellules proliférantes sont disposées en des amas solides avec disposition en palissade à la périphérie. Il existe également de foyers comportant de formations canalaires parfois dilatées. Le diagnostic d'un carcinome basocellulaire kystique a été ainsi retenu.","

La patiente a également rapporté la notion de sueurs nocturnes, d'anorexie et de discrète altération de l’état général.
L'examen de la marche retrouvait une boiterie secondaire au raccourcissement du membre inférieur droit d'environ 2 centimètres. L'inspection en position debout de la patiente retrouvait une volumineuse tuméfaction de la face postérieure de la cuisse droite d'environ 30 centimètres de grand diamètre s’étendant du pli fessier inférieure jusqu'au quart inférieur de la face postérieure de la cuisse droite . Il s'agissait d'une tuméfaction non douloureuse, de consistance molle, sans signes inflammatoires associés et mobile par rapport au plans superficiel et profond. Le reste de l'examen était sans particularité. Par ailleurs, on a noté l'absence d'adénopathies au niveau du pli inguinal et du creux poplité. A la radiographie standard, on a retrouvé une volumineuse opacité se projetant au niveau de la face postérieure de la cuisse droite . L’échographie quant à elle a objectivé une image hypoechogène homogène. Le bilan a été complété par une TDM qui a montré une masse hypodense de tonalité liquidienne affleurant le plan sous cutané .
L'abord chirurgical de la masse a découvert un abcès superficiel, de contenu jaunâtre. L'intervention a consisté en l'ablation de la gaine de l'abcès qui se logeait entre le plan sous cutané et l'aponévrose de la loge postérieure de la cuisse droite et qui s’étendait à travers les interstices musculaires jusqu'au sacrum. L’étude anatomopathologique a confirmé la présence de granulomes épithelio-giganto-cellulaires avec nécrose caséeuse.

Une vaccination au BCG a été faite et nous avons noté une notion de contage tuberculeux dans la famille. A l'examen physique, nous avons objectivé des métrorragies qui survenaient de manière spontanées, associées à des douleurs pelviennes d'évolution intermittentes, des leucorrhées non fétides. Au toucher vaginal, le col était dur, légèrement sensible et le doigtier souillé de sang. L'examen au spéculum montrait un col augmenté de volume, épaissi et induré sans ulcération, à bords irréguliers, saignant au contact. Le reste de l'examen est sans particularités. Deux échographies pelviennes ont été réalisées mais ne décelant aucune anomalie. Une tomodensitométrie abdominopelvienne a été faite retrouvant un col utérin modérément épaissi avec des contours antérolatéraux irréguliers, postéro latéraux irréguliers en rapport avec l'infiltration des paramètres, un épaississement modéré du 1/3 supérieur du vagin, une absence d'infiltration suspect des structures urinaires et digestive pelviennes, des adénopathies iliaques bilatérales et retro péritonéales, une absence de localisation néoplasique, séquelles bilatérales de pyélonéphrite et concluait à une tumeur du col de l'utérus de stade T3bN1M0 . Cependant une première biopsie du col avec étude histologique pour confirmation trouvait une inflammation chronique non spécifique. Une seconde biopsie trouvait un granulome avec zone de nécrose faisant conclure à une tuberculose du col utérin. Elle montrait une muqueuse endocervicale siège d'un infiltrat inflammatoire granulomateux épithélio-giganto-cellulaire et la nécrose . Une poursuite des explorations trouvait une intradermoréaction à la tuberculine phlycténulaire à 21 mm, une CRP positive à 12 mg. L'étude cytobactériologique des urines était normale. Des examens complémentaires à la recherche d'un terrain particulier étaient alors demandés: la radiographie des poumons et la radiographie du rachis dorsolombaire étaient normales, l'utérus et ses annexes étaient normaux à l'échographie pelvienne, la sérologie rétrovirale de l'immunodéficience humaine était négative. Sur la base des résultats des éléments cliniques, des éléments présomptifs paraclinique et surtout de l'examen anatomopathologique, un traitement antituberculeux est entrepris pour 6 mois, selon le protocole national.

L'examen clinique à l'admission trouve une dysmorphie crânio-faciale faite d'une craniosténose type brachycéphalie, un aplatissement de l'occiput, un bombement frontal antérieur, une exophtalmie bilatérale avec lagophtalmie, un hypertélorisme, une dépression de la racine du nez avec un petit nez et une ensellure nasale ronde, un rétrognatisme, une fente palatine, une luette bifide, une malposition dentaire et des pavillons d'oreilles décollés . Ceci est associé à une syndactylie des mains touchant les 2ème, 3ème, 4ème et 5ème doigts de façon bilatérale et symétrique, un pouce court et large à son extrémité avec clinodactylie, une syndactylie des 5 orteils des pieds et des gros orteils trapus, une marche avec élargissement du polygone de sustentation, un rire spasmodique, un micropénis et une débilité mentale modérée.
L'examen ophtalmologique a montré des taies de la cornée prédominant du coté gauche, le segment antérieur et le fond d''il sont normaux. L'examen oto-rhino-laryngologique a objectivé des conduits auditifs rétrécis et une fente palatine incomplète. L’échocardiographie est normale. La radiographie des membres a révélé une fusion osseuse des phalanges distales des IIIème et IVème doigts des deux mains. Le scanner cérébral a montré une fermeture de toutes les sutures crâniennes réalisant une craniosténose avec microcrânie et une légère dilatation des ventricules latéraux. L’étude génétique n'a pu être réalisée par manque des moyens financiers des parents.
La prise en charge a consisté à la prescription de larmes artificielles pour prévenir la sécheresse oculaire et des stéristrips pour protection oculaire le soir. La neurochirurgie correctrice de la craniosténose n'a pu être réalisée car l'enfant n'a consulté qu’à l’âge de 10 ans. Par ailleurs, il est adressé en chirurgie orthopédique et réparatrice pour libération des doigts afin d'obtenir une main fonctionnelle.","

CR_FRE_179,French,"Patiente âgée de 32 ans, adressée au service d'ORL et chirurgie cervico-faciale de l'hôpital 20 Aout de Casablanca, pour une tuméfaction jugale droite douloureuse, évoluant progressivement depuis 1 année, avec obstruction nasale, sans autres signes associées, notamment pas d’épistaxis, ni signes oculaires. L'anamnèse ne retrouve aucun antécédent pathologique particulier, notamment pas d'histoire familiale d'hyperparathyroidie, ou autre endocrinopathie. L'examen clinique avait mis en évidence une asymétrie faciale due à une tumeur gingivo-maxillaire dure, comblant le vestibule supérieur et entrainant une voussure du palais. Des déplacements avec mobilité dentaires ont été observés dans la zone atteinte, avec chute de la 12emeet 13emedent . Le reste de l'examen somatique n'a pas révélé d'anomalies, notamment pas d'adénopathies ni de douleurs osseuses. La tomodensitométrie a objectivé une masse tissulaire ostéolytique hétérodense, largement nécrosé, siège de calcifications, centré sur le sinus maxillaire droit mesurant 52 mm/35mm, s’étendant en dedans dans les cellules éthmoïdales et la fosse nasale homolatérale refoule et infiltre la cloison nasale. En haut, il lyse le plancher de l'orbite et infiltre la graisse extra conique. En bas, il lyse le palais osseux et bombe dans la cavité buccale et lyse le processus alvéolaire, en avant, il lyse la paroi antérieure du sinus maxillaire et s’étend dans les parties molles en regard . La rhinocavoscopie a révélé une masse comblant totalement la fosse nasale droite sans altération de la muqueuse pituitaire. Une biopsie tumorale a été réalisée dans le même temps, elle a objectivé un aspect en faveur d'un ostéosarcome.
Se basant sur les données de l'examen clinique, radiologiques objectivant une tumeur agressive localement, et le résultat de l'examen anatomopathologique en faveur de la malignité, l'intervention chirurgicale a été décidée. La patiente a subi une maxillectomie médiane droite par voie transfaciale, l'exérèse de la tumeur est réalisée en monobloc emportant l'os nasal droit, le processus frontal du maxillaire, l'os lacrymal, la paroi latérale de la fosse nasale, le plancher de l'orbite dans sa partie antéro-interne, arrivant en dehors jusqu’à l'os zygomatique, et emportant en arrière la tubérosité maxillaire, en bas les 2/3 droit du palais osseux. La pièce mesure 6/5, 5/4 cm, comporte 2 molaires et une incisive . La reconstruction a consisté en la mise en place d'un obturateur provisoire en silicone, en attendant la prothèse définitive. L'aspect histopathologique était celui d'une tumeur à cellules géantes bénigne grade I et II, compte tenu le siège inhabituel, le diagnostic différentiel se pose avec un granulome réparateur à cellule géantes et une tumeur brune dans le cadre d'une hyperparathyroïdie. Pas de signe de malignité décelable . Devant l'association des données: radiologiques: image ostéolytique, et histologiques: tumeur à cellule géante, le diagnostic de tumeurs brunes des maxillaires à été évoqué. Le bilan phosphocalcique a montré, une hypercalcémie à 133 mg/L et une hypophosphorémie à 17 mg/L. Les phosphatases alkalines étaient à 227 U/L (normal range 30 à 100 U/L); le bilan rénal (urée, créatininémie) était normal. La protidémie était normale. Le bilan sanguin a suggéré le diagnostic d'hyperparathyroïdie primaire initialement exprimé par une tumeur brune du maxillaire, ce qui a poussé les investigations à la recherche de l’étiologie en cause. L’échographie cervicale a permis de déceler un nodule hypoéchogène basi-cervical gauche rétro thyroïdien droit évoquant un adénome parathyroïdien.
La tomodensitométrie cervicale, a conforté le diagnostic en montrant une masse bien limitée, hétérodense, mesurant 35x 20 x15mm, en situation rétro et infra thyroïdienne droite, refoulant le lobe droit en haut et en avant en faveur d'un adénome parathyroïdien . Le dosage de la PTH a montré un niveau très élevé à 322 pmol/L (valeurs normales: 9-55), L'ablation de l'adénome parathyroïdien a été réalisée après 1 mois du diagnostic. La masse mesurait 3.5× 2.5 cm . Le rapport anatomopathologique était en faveur d'un adénome parathyroïdien.
Une scintigraphie osseuse a montré une hyperfixation diffuse de l'ensemble du squelette: de la voute crânienne plus marquée au niveau des maxillaires, des humérus, des sacro-iliaques, et du pubis. Deux mois après la parathyroïdectomie, le bilan sanguine, y compris: la calcémie et la phosphorémie, est redevenu normal. Le dosage de la parathormone s'est normalisé après quatre mois 33 pmol/L.","

CR_FRE_180,French,"Informations sur le patient: nous rapportons le cas d´une patiente âgée de 46 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, qui a consulté en juin 2020 pour une volumineuse masse abdominale évoluant depuis plus d´un an.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen a montré une masse de 20 cm de grand axe para-ombilicale gauche, non douloureuse et mobile par rapport au plan profond . La patiente n´a pas rapporté de signes digestifs associés.
Démarche diagnostique: pour mieux spécifier cette tumeur et étudier ses rapports, un complément d´exploration par imagerie par résonance magnétique (IRM) abdominale en juillet 2020 a montré une volumineuse masse tissulaire aux dépens du muscle droit de l´abdomen gauche grossièrement ovalaire de contours lobulés mesurant 190x188x160 mm faiblement hypo-dense qui prend le contraste après injection de gadolinium . Devant ce tableau une tumeur fibromateuse type desmoïde a été évoquée et une colonoscopie a été demandée à la recherche de polypes coliques associés, revenue sans anomalies.
Intervention thérapeutique: la patiente a été opérée par laparotomie médiane. L´exploration peropératoire montre une masse polylobée aux dépends des différentes tuniques adjacentes de la paroi abdominale gauche sans extension ni localisations secondaires intra-péritonéale. Une résection en monobloc de cette masse a été faite emportant le plan cutané, sous cutané, la partie musculaire envahie ainsi que ses aponévroses et le plan péritonéal adjacent avec une marge chirurgicale macroscopique de sécurité minimale de 1 cm en latéral et en profondeur . La fermeture pariétale a nécessité un geste de reconstruction par une prothèse synthétique biface .
Suivi et résultats des interventions thérapeutiques: l´étude histologique de la pièce opératoire a confirmé le diagnostic d´une fibromatose agressive en montrant un agencement cellulaire en longs faisceaux divergents dissociant le muscle strié avec marge de résection microscopique saine . Le dossier a été présenté en réunion de concertation pluridisciplinaire et un traitement adjuvant postopératoire n´a pas été indiqué. Un contrôle à 6 mois clinique et scannographique n´a pas montré de signes de récidive locale.
Perspectives du patient: la patiente a déclaré être satisfaite de la qualité de la prise en charge et des soins fournis.
Consentement éclairé: la patiente a fourni son consentement.","

CR_FRE_181,French,"Il s'agit de monsieur M. âgé de 32 ans, marié, commerçant, pesant 49 Kg et mesure 1, 60m. Il est entré dans le service de Réanimation chirurgicale Hôpital joseph Ravoahangy Andrianavalona pour une hémorragie digestive à type de melaena. Depuis une semaine avant son admission, le malade éprouve des malaises digestifs sous forme de coliques abdominales localisées surtout au niveau de la partie inferieure de l'abdomen. La douleur est surtout maximale après la prise alimentaire. Elle s'aggrave et devient diffuse. Le patient consulte un médecin qui lui prescrit un anti spasmodique. Mais, malgré ce traitement il n'y a pas d'amélioration, son état général s'altère, il perd l'appétit et ses selles deviennent rouges noirâtres, d'où son hospitalisation dans le service de Réanimation Chirurgicale HJRA. Une échographie abdominale est effectuée et ne révèle aucune anomalie. Lors d'une enquête étiologique, il a présenté des douleurs abdominales à répétition depuis l’âge de 15 ans et il a mentionné une notion des petites taches noires au niveau de ses lèvres vers l’âge de 4 ans qui disparaissent progressivement jusqu’à l’âge de 30 ans. Depuis un an, il a présenté une épigastralgie à répétition mais il n'a reçu aucun traitement adapté. Il n'a aucun antécédent chirurgical. C'est un sujet alcoolique, mais non tabagique. Ses parents sont encore en vie et n'ont aucun antécédent particulier. Il est l'ainé d'une fratrie de trois dont les deux autres filles sont en bonne santé apparente. Il est père d'une fille de 4 ans et d'un garçon de 2 ans qui sont tous les deux en bonne santé; et d'après l'interrogatoire aucune tache n'est trouvée sur leurs corps. À l´admission, l´examen clinique a trouvé un patient conscient avec un état général altéré, et des conjonctives très pâles. Il avait une pression artérielle basse (90>50mmHg); et une tachycardie à 106 battements par minute (bpm).
L'examen physique a montré un abdomen de volume normal, souple mais douloureux à la palpation de l'hypogastre. L'examen des autres appareils a été normal. Arrivé en réanimation, nous avons mis en condition le malade. En plus d'une voie veineuse déjà posée au service des urgences, nous avons posé une deuxième voie veineuse 18G au niveau de son bras. Nous avons pratiqué un prélèvement sanguin pour analyse biologique et pour le groupage sanguin. Nous avons procédé au remplissage vasculaire par des macromolécules (Hydroxyéthylamidon: Héstar®) 500ml et cristalloïdes (sérum salé isotonique 0, 9% et Ringer Lactate) 1000mL par 24 heures en attendant les résultats biologiques. Le patient a été gardé à jeun. L'apport calorique a été assuré par du sérum glucosé hypertonique 10% (1000mL par 24 heures). Il a reçu un inhibiteur de pompe à proton (Omeprazole) 40mg par jour, et des électrolytes, KCl 3g/j.
Une demande de fibroscopie digestive haute d'urgence a été faite. Un lavement évacuateur a été faite chaque jour pour évaluer les caractères de saignement et pour évacuer les selles. Les surveillances de l’état hémodynamique ont été rapprochées: Pression Artérielle (PA), Fréquence Cardiaque (FC), diurèse: toutes les heures au minimum. L'apport hydrique était modifié en fonction du bilan hydrique. Au deuxième jour: L'hypotension artérielle a persisté (PA: 90>50mmHg; FC: 105bpm) Le lavement évacuateur a été noirâtre. La numération de la formule sanguine (NFS) a révélé: une anémie microcytaire normochrome assez sévère; Hémoglobine (Hb): 78g/dL; VGM: 84µ; CCMH: 334 g/L; un taux de plaquettes normal (157 109/L). L'hémostase secondaire a été normale (TP:89, 05%; TCA: 28, 8s/29, 3s) Les résultats de la glycémie, urée, créatininémie, ionogramme sanguin sont normaux. En plus des mesures précédentes nous avons commencé la transfusion sanguine par deux culots globulaires (CG) iso-groupe iso-rhésus et une poche de plasma frais congelé (PFC). Au troisième jour: malgré notre réanimation, la pression artérielle reste toujours basse (PA: 90/50mmHg; FC: 96bpm). La fibroscopie oeso-gastroduodénale (FOGD) a montré une muqueuse œsophagienne normale, le cardia a été normal. Par contre, l'exploration de l'estomac a montré un lac muqueux hémorragique qui a gêné l'examen. Le contrôle de la NFS a montré encore une anémie normocytaire normochrome assez sévère (Hb: 74 g/L) et une thrombopénie modérée (Plaquettes: 109 109/L) Nous avons continué la transfusion sanguine par des culots globulaires et du PFC. Au sixième jour: La pression artérielle reste toujours basse, le lavement évacuateur devient rouge. L'anémie a persisté (Hb: 73g/L) accompagnée d'une thrombopénie (plaquette: 76.109/L). La reprise de la FOGD a montré un lac muqueux sanguinolent d'abondance normale dans l'estomac. Au niveau de la face postérieure du fundus ils ont trouvé un ulcère plus ou moins vaste à fond blanchâtre avec du caillot adhérent à la périphérie. Le diagnostic d'une hémorragie digestive haute par un ulcère gastrique a été posé. Nous avons démarré la trithérapie par: Deux antibiotiques: Amoxicilline 1g trois fois par jour Metronidazole 500mg trois fois par jour, Un inhibiteur de pompe à proton: Oméprazole (Lomac®) 40mg par jour. Au septième jour: Le patient est tombé brutalement dans un état de choc hémorragique sévère, avec une perte de connaissance, sa pression artérielle a chuté (PA:70>50mmHg avec FC: 110 bpm), ses selles étaient rouges noirâtres. La NFS d'urgence a montré une anémie normocytaire normochrome assez sévère. (Hb: 69g/L; VGM: 86µ3; CCMH: 335g/L). Nous avons mis le patient en tête basse (position de Trendelenburg). Nous avons apporté de l'oxygène par des lunettes nasales à 6L/min avec un remplissage vasculaire par transfusion de culot globulaire iso groupe iso-rhésus. Au huitième jour: Le remplissage vasculaire et la transfusion sanguine n'arrivent pas à rétablir l’état hémodynamique du patient. Nous avons demandé l'avis du chirurgien de garde qui a posé l'indication d'une intervention chirurgicale d'urgence pour faire l'hémostase. Nous avons préparé le malade pour l'intervention. Nous avons mis en place une voie veineuse centrale sous-clavière droite16G. L'hypovolémie a été corrigée par une perfusion de colloïdes (Héstar® 500 ml) et par une transfusion de trois poches de sang total iso groupes iso-rhésus. Le patient a été toujours gardé à jeun. Après quelques heures de préparation, il a été prêt pour l'intervention. Il a eu une PA à 110> 60 mmHg avec une FC à 90 bpm.
L'intervention consistait à une laparotomie médiane sous ombilicale. Après une gastrotomie, on n'a trouvé que du liquide gastrique (absence de sang). La recherche de la lésion a objectivé un ulcère déjà cicatrisé sans réaction inflammatoire, donc fermeture de la gastrotomie. Une vérification sur l'intestin grêle a retrouvé une petite tumeur polypoïde sessile; 1 cm de diamètre qui se trouve à 30cm de l'iléon terminal. On a procédé à l'ablation de la tumeur, fermeture de l'intestin grêle et fermeture plan par plan de la paroi. La pièce opératoire a été envoyée pour examen anatomo-cyto-pathologique. Aucun incident n'est trouvé pendant l'intervention, son état hémodynamique reste stable.
Les suites opératoires étaient simples, elles étaient marquées par une amélioration; stabilisation de l’état hémodynamique; une reprise du transit au deuxième jour postopératoire. Le lavement évacuateur est devenu clair au bout de trois jours. Le traitement post opératoire comportait à une rééquilibration hydro-électrolytique guidée par le bilan hydrique et les résultats des analyses biologiques, une alimentation parentérale par de l'Oliclinomel® 1L par jour, une antibiothérapie; un inhibiteur de pompe à proton; un antalgique. L'alimentation orale a été débutée à partir du 5ème jour postopératoire par des aliments mous. Le résultat de l'examen d'anatomie pathologique de la pièce opératoire a montré qu'il ne s'agit pas d'une tumeur maligne. La muqueuse est d'aspect normal. Au niveau de la sous-muqueuse ils ont observé des structures glandulaires hamartomateuses accompagnées de faisceaux de fibres musculaires lisses et de gros vaisseaux dilatés et congestifs. L'aspect de la lésion évoque un polype hamartomateux .
Le diagnostic d'un syndrome de Peutz-Jeghers a été posé devant l'association de ce polype hamartomateux et la notion de lentiginose sur ses lèvres dans son enfance. Le patient a bénéficié par la suite d'un examen clinique minutieux, d´une échographie abdominale et prostatique, à la recherche de cancer. Les examens se sont révélés sans particularités. On lui a bien expliqué le syndrome de Peutz-Jeghers, le risque de récidive de complication, le risque de cancer à de très jeune âge, et les surveillances périodiques qu'il doit faire. Le patient est sorti de l'hôpital au 10ème jour postopératoire. Depuis, on n'a plus des nouvelles de lui.","

CR_FRE_182,French,"Mme M S S âgée de 25 ans, sans antécédents particuliers personnels ou familiaux connus, quatrième geste, troisième pare dont 3 enfants vivants bien portants, qui présentait une semaine avant son admission, dans un contexte d'aménorrhée 5 mois avec des vomissements incoercibles et algies diffuses, un syndrome neurogène périphérique des 4 membres avec une quadriparèsie cotée à 1/5 aux membres inférieurs et 2/5 aux membres supérieurs, des réflexes ostéo-tendineux abolis, une hypotonie généralisée. Il y avait également une hyperglycémie pure à 1, 72g/L. Par ailleurs les constantes hémodynamiques étaient bonnes avec une pression artérielle à 110/80mmHg, une température à 36°, un pouls à 100 battements par minute, une fréquence respiratoire à 16 cycles par minute. La conscience était claire avec un score de Glasgow à 15. Il n'y avait pas de troubles sensitifs. Les réflexes cutanéo-plantaires étaient en flexion. L'examen des nerfs crâniens était normal. Il n'y avait pas de signes méningés ni de troubles trophiques. La respiration était calme et régulière et la saturation à l'aire ambiante à 98%. La diurèse était conservée. L’échographie obstétricale objectivait une grossesse évolutive d'environ 22 semaines d'aménorrhée. La radiographie pulmonaire était normale. L’électrocardiogramme montrait un sous-décalage du segment ST. Il y avait une anémie normochrome microcytaire à 10, 5g/dL. Les enzymes musculaires (CPK et LDH) étaient normales de même que les transaminases. La fonction rénale était conservée. L'ionogramme sanguin était perturbé avec une hypokaliémie à 2mmol/L, une natrémie normale à 138mmol/L et une chlorémie à 85mmol/L. Le bilan phosphocalcique et les enzymes thyroïdiennes et l’électroneuromyogramme (fait à distance) étaient normaux. Cependant l'ionogramme urinaire, la gazométrie et le dosage des bicarbonates n’étaient pas réalisés de même que le bilan génétique. Ainsi nous évoquions le diagnostic d'une paralysie hypokaliémique due aux vomissements gravidiques. Le traitement consistait à une supplémentation potassique par du chlorure de potassium en raison de 1g/heure au pousse-seringue électrique à travers un cathéter jugulaire pendant 5 heures sur 2 jours. Nous en associons une réhydratation par du sérum physiologique et un traitement antiémétique par du métopimazine. L’électrocardiogramme réalisé bi-quotidiennement était devenu normal. La glycémie était devenue normale après 2 jours de réhydratation. A j + 3 nous notions une bonne évolution clinique avec une récupération motrice de la patiente qui commençait à se déplacer toute seule. A j + 4 elle sortait de l'hôpital avec un traitement per os potassique, martial et antiémétique avec une demande de consultation en gynécologie. A j + 21 elle revenait en consultation neurologique avec un ionogramme sanguin normal sans signe neurologique particulier.
Mme D.B âgée de 20 ans primigeste nullipare sans antécédents particuliers signalés qui était admise pour paralysie des 4 membres sur grossesse d'environ 4 mois suivie en gynécologie. Son tableau clinique évoluait depuis 2 semaines et s'installait de manière progressive dans un contexte de vomissements gravidiques rebelles aux traitements habituels avec asthénie et myalgies. L'examen à l'admission retrouvait un état général conservé, une pression artérielle à 100/70mmHg, une température à 37°4, un pouls à 98 battements par minute, une fréquence respiratoire à 24 cycles par minute, une saturation pulsée à 96% en aire. La conscience était claire avec un score de Glasgow à 15 mais nous notions une patiente anxieuse pour son état. Il y avait une quadriparèsie à prédominance proximal cotée à 3/5 aux 4 membres avec une hypotonie généralisée sans troubles trophiques. Les réflexes ostéo-tendineux étaient diminués et les réflexes cutanéo-plantaires en flexion. Il n'y avait pas de trouble de la sensibilité. La respiration était un peu rapide mais quand même régulière et il y avait une bonne diurèse. Le reste de l'examen était sans particularité. L’échographie obstétricale montrait une grossesse viable de 18 semaines d'aménorrhée. La radiographie des poumons était normale et l’électrocardiogramme montrait un aplatissement de l'onde T. L'ionogramme sanguin retrouvait une hypokaliémie à 2, 5mmol/L, une natrémie à 140mmol/L, une chlorémie à 88mmol/L. Les enzymes musculaire et thyroïdienne, de même que la numération globulaire étaient normales. Il n'y avait aucune histoire familiale particulière notée cependant l'analyse génétique n’était pas faite et l'ENMG réalisé plutard était normal. Sous traitement à base de chlorure de potassium par voie parentérale (pousse-seringue électrique avec cathéter fémoral) en raison de 1g/heure pendant 8 heures. A cela nous associons une réhydratation et un traitement antiémétique. Douze heures après le début du traitement nous notions un début d'amélioration clinique et biologique avec une récupération sur le plan moteur et une kaliémie à 3, 8 mmol/L. Le lendemain nous notions un amendement des vomissements, une récupération à 100% sur le plan moteur avec une kaliémie à 4mmol/L et un électrocardiogramme normal. Il s'agissait donc d'une paralysie hypokaliémique suite à des vomissements incoercibles sur une grossesse de 16 semaines d'aménorrhée.","

CR_FRE_183,French,"Information du patient: il s´agissait d´un patient âgé de 43 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques particuliers. Le patient présentait une masse de la face postéro-supérieure gauche du thorax. Cette masse évoluait depuis sept ans. Elle était indolore et rendait difficile le décubitus dorsal et pesant sur le dos. Ceci avait motivé un traitement traditionnel par massage et phytothérapie sans succès.
Résultats cliniques: à l´examen clinique, il présentait une tumeur mobile par rapport à la peau et à la paroi thoracique d´environ 23 cm/15 cm de grand axe, de consistance molle, siégeant à la face postéro-supérieure gauche du thorax. Elle était indolore avec une ulcération de 5 cm à son sommet sans vascularisation visible .
Démarche diagnostique: la tomodensitométrie thoracique réalisée avait montré une volumineuse masse oblongue sous cutanée dorsale gauche de densité graisseuse (-100 UH) multi loculée mesurant 22, 94 cm/15, 87 cm, à contours bien limités, réguliers. Sa paroi n´était pas rehaussée par le produit de contraste .
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: une exérèse totale de la tumeur a été réalisée par incision arciforme, puis décollement antérieur et postérieur aux doigts et énucléation après ligature du pédicule nourricier . L´excédent de peau était réséqué permettant une fermeture esthétique sur drain de Redon aspiratif . La pièce d´exérèse mesurait 23 cm/15 cm et pesait 2800 grammes . Les suites opératoires étaient simples avec ablation du drain au deuxième jour post-opératoire. L´étude histologique de la pièce opératoire avait conclu à un lipome lipocytique sans signes de malignité. Après un recul de six mois, le patient ne présentait pas de récidive.
Consentement du patient: le patient a donné son consentement éclairé pour la publication de ce cas.","

CR_FRE_184,French,"Le patient est âgé de 20 ans, il n’a pas de comorbidités. Il présente initialement un tableau associant fièvre, asthénie, arthromyalgies et toux sèche ; l’apparition secondaire d’une dyspnée l’amène à consulter aux urgences. La PCR SARS-Cov-2 et le scanner thoracique confirment une pneumonie virale à COVID-19.
Il est transféré en réanimation devant l’installation d’un SDRA sévère nécessitant une ventilation mécanique d’une durée de 24 jours, avec séances de décubitus ventral, et une corticothérapie selon les recommandations . Il présente également des complications thromboemboliques et infectieuses avec PAVM (pneumopathie acquise sous ventilation mécanique).
En sortie de réanimation, le patient présente des troubles de la déglutition post-extubation avec un déficit bilatéral de protaction linguale sans lésion à l’IRM (imagerie par résonance magnétique), ponction lombaire normale et sans anomalie neurogène à l’EMG (électroneuromyogramme), faisant poser le diagnostic d’une atteinte neurologique spécifique du SARS-Cov-2.
Les troubles de la phonation et de la déglutition évoluent favorablement ; toutefois il persiste une légère hypoesthésie du moignon de l’épaule gauche associée à un déficit franc de l’élévation et de l’abduction, et décollement de la scapula gauche.
Le bilan respiratoire est réalisé devant une dyspnée persistante à 4 mois du diagnostic de pneumonie virale à COVID-19. Le scanner thoracique en procubitus et la scintigraphie pulmonaire ne révèlent pas d’anomalies parenchymateuses ou vasculaires(Fig. 1C), mais une ascension de coupole diaphragmatique gauche déjà présente sur les radiographies thoraciques suivant l’épisode neurologique . L’exploration fonctionnelle respiratoire (EFR) révèle un trouble ventilatoire restrictif modéré avec une CPT (Capacité Pulmonaire Totale) à 5, 7 L soit 66 % de la théorique, sans diminution significative de la CVL (capacité vitale lente) en position couchée (4, 2 L soit 64 % de la théorique en position assise, et 4, 1 L soit 62 % de la théorique en position couchée), mais associé à une altération modérée des muscles respiratoires avec un SNIP test (Sniff nasal inspiratory pressure) diminué à 61 cm H2O soit 51 % de la valeur théorique, une Pi max (Pression inspiratoire maximale) diminuée à 65 % et une Pe max (pression expiratoire maximale) à 67 %. Enfin, l’échographie diaphragmatique confirme la parésie diaphragmatique gauche (B, 2C) avec un net mouvement paradoxal au sniff test, une amplitude au repos et forcée de 1, 5 cm et une fraction d’épaississement de 13 %.
L’EMG met en évidence des anomalies neurogènes chroniques et actives des territoires C5 et C6 sans anomalies des conductions sensitives écartant une atteinte du tronc primaire supérieur du plexus brachial, sans atteinte au niveau de C4. L’échographie de l’épaule révèle une amyotrophie de l’infra-épineux gauche avec une involution graisseuse, sans atteinte tendineuse. L’IRM musculaire retrouve, d’une part, une atrophie de l’infra-épineux, du deltoïde mais surtout un hypersignal œdémateux (STIR) dans les muscles supra, infra-épineux, deltoïde, rhomboïde et petit pectoral gauche compatible avec des signes de dénervation des territoires C5-C6 mais également du nerf pectoral latéral (B). Il existait, d’autre part, un hypersignal STIR sur le trajet des faisceaux nerveux issus de C5 gauche, sans anomalie de calibre ou lésion décelable en IRM ou échographie .
L’hypothèse d’une atteinte traumatique, suite aux séances de décubitus ventral ou à la pose de voie veineuse centrale, est écartée par l’absence de lésion du plexus en imagerie, l’absence d’atteinte sensitive dans le territoire du tronc primaire à l’EMG et surtout l’atteinte conjointe du nerf pectoral latéral dont l’origine et le trajet diffèrent du tronc primaire du plexus brachial. Le diagnostic d’atteinte post-infectieuse de type SPT est finalement retenu.
La prise en charge a comporté une kinésithérapie de reconditionnement diaphragmatique suivie d’une réévaluation fonctionnelle, sans corticothérapie compte tenu d’une atteinte respiratoire modérée, sans symptomatologie douloureuse et un délai de prise en charge tardif.","

CR_FRE_185,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d´une patiente âgée de 24 ans, diagnostiquée à l´âge de 5 ans d´un syndrome de « McCune Albright ». La patiente présentait alors une dysplasie fibreuse des os, des taches cutanées « café au lait » et une puberté précoce. La patiente a reçu un an après en 2001 une cure de Pamidronate (biphosphonate de deuxième génération) à raison de 180 mg tous les 6 mois, pendant 2 ans. En 2001, la patiente a présenté une fissure au niveau de l´extrémité proximale du fémur . Un enclouage par deux broches de Metaizeau a été réalisé . En 2005, la patiente a présenté une fissure de contrainte au niveau de la partie inférieure du col fémoral . La patiente a bénéficié de la mise en place d´une lame plaque après curetage et greffe autologue cortico-spongieuse prélevée à partir de la crête iliaque. La radio de contrôle à 6 mois montre une consolidation osseuse complète. En 2015, la patiente a présenté une fracture du fémur au niveau de l´extrémité distale de la lame plaque traitée par ablation de cette lame plaque et mise en place d´un clou centromédullaire verrouillé. La fracture a malheureusement évolué vers la pseudarthrose . La patiente a été opérée en septembre 2018. Lors d´une première anesthésie, 50 ml de moelle osseuse étaient aspirés de la crête iliaque postérieure. Les cellules mésenchymateuses stromales étaient isolées et amplifées au laboratoire pendant 3 semaines, jusqu´à obtention de 200 millions de cellules mésenchymateuses stromales. Le jour de l´intervention, les cellules mésenchymateuses étaient mélangées à 10 cm3 de granules de substitut osseux synthétique pendant 1 heure, puis ce mélange a été utilisé en lieu et place d´une autogreffe spongieuse au niveau de la pseudarthrose après abord chirurgical et décortication . La consolidation totale a été obtenue après 4 mois . Il n´y a eu aucune complication clinique, biologique ou septique lié au prélèvement ou à l´utilisation des cellules mésenchymateuses.","

CR_FRE_186,French,"Un patient de 52 ans, connu hypertendu depuis 5 ans sous régime seul, était admis pour un syndrome méningé fébrile. L'analyse du LCR retrouvait 650 éléments blancs/mm3 dont 82% de polynucléaires neutrophiles, une hyperprotéinorachie à 1, 06 g/l et une glycorachie normale. L'examen direct, la culture ainsi que la recherche des antigènes solubles étaient négatifs. Le bilan biologique révélait un syndrome inflammatoire (VS à 50mm, CRP à 40mg/l). La numération formule sanguine, les fonctions hépatique et rénale étaient normales. Le patient a été mis sous penicilline A (200 mg/kg/j pendant 10 jours) avec bonne évolution; la PL de contrôle retrouvait 5 éléments/mm3 avec un taux de protides à 0.2g/l. Trois mois plus tard, il était réadmis pour des céphalées intenses, avec vomissements et hémiparésie gauche. L'examen clinique trouvait un patient apyrétique, normotendu. L'examen neurologique notait un ptosis de l’œil gauche et une hémiparésie gauche. On retrouvait également une aphtose buccale et génitale. L'IRM cérébrale mettait en évidence des anomalies bilatérales sous forme de plages en hyper signal T2 et Flair, avec absence de thrombophlébite en séquence angiographique . La PL retrouvait 312 éléments blancs, avec 84% de lymphocytes, un liquide normoglycorachique, normochlorurorachique et normoprotéinorachique. Le bilan biologique révélait une anémie normocytaire à 9g/dl, une hyperleucocytose à 12200/mm3 à prédominance polynucléaires neutrophiles et un syndrome inflammatoire (VS à 85mm et CRP à 191 mg/l). La fonction rénale était normale. Les anticorps antinucléaires étaient négatifs. La recherche d'HLA B51 est revenue positive. Le diagnostic de maladie de Behçet était alors posé. L'hypothèse d'un neuro-Behçet était retenue dans ce contexte. Le patient a reçu un bolus de méthyl-prédnisolone (15mg/kg/j pendant 3j) relayé par de la prédnisone orale à 1mg/kg/j avec dégression progressive et la colchicine 1mg/j. L’évolution était rapidement favorable sur le plan clinique et biologique (VS: 20mm; CRP: 4mg/l). Vu l'atteinte neurologique grave, un traitement immunosuppresseur à base de bolus de cyclophosphamide (15mg/kg/mois) a été associé. Le recul actuel est de 7 mois, le patient est à son 8ème bolus de cyclophosphamide, il est stable, sous 20mg/j de prédnisone.","

Le début de la symptomatologie remonte à 3 mois où la patiente a présenté des douleurs abdominales diffuses isolées. L′examen clinique a révélé une matité diffuse et la taille utérine a été difficilement appréciable. Le bilan biologique a révélé un taux de Ca 125 élevé avec un test à la tuberculine négative et la recherche de BK dans les crachats sur trois prélèvements a été négative. La radiographie thoracique a été normale. Une échographie abdominopelvienne a objectivé la présence d'une ascite de moyenne abondance, un utérus de taille normale une image en rétro utérine hétérogène, échogène, mal limitée par endroit, ne prenant pas le doppler couleur, les ovaires non vus . La tomodensitométrie abdominale a montré la présence de deux lésions tissulaires ovariennes bilatérales avec des adénopathies intra et rétropéritonèales ainsi qu′un épanchement intra péritonéal enkysté. La décision de laparotomie a été prise au cours de laquelle l'exploration a permis d'objectiver la présence d'une ascite cloisonnée faite de liquide séro hématique, un pelvis adhérentiel, avec présence d′une masse à surface irrégulière latéro et rétro utérine droite faisant 5cm, son ouverture accidentelle donne issu à un liquide blanchâtre prélevé. L'ovaire gauche a été vu mais l'ovaire controlatéral n'a pas été visualisé. L'examen extemporané de la coque de la collection est revenu en faveur de granulome inflammatoire avec nécrose caséeuse, ce qui a été confirmé à l'examen anatomopathologique définitif avec un résultat en faveur d'une paroi tubaire dont l’épithélium est hyperplasique et le chorion est siège d'une lésion granulomateuse de tuberculose ovarienne avec nécrose caséeuse. La biopsie des granulations a été en faveur de lésions granulomateuse et la cytologie du liquide péritonéal est en faveur d'un liquide inflammatoire. La patiente a été déclarée sortante trois jours après avec des suites opératoires simples, mise sous chimiothérapie antibacillaire à base de 2ERHZ/4RH. L′évolution a été bonne.","

L'examen clinique était sans anomalies et le bilan biologique trouvait une fonction rénale correcte (créatininémie à 74.5 µmol/l), une numération formule sanguine était normale et un ECBU était stérile. L’échographie abdominale trouvait une masse tissulaire hypoéchogéne de 12 cm rénale gauche. Le scanner thoracoabdolminopelvien montrait une volumineuse masse tissulaire médio-rénale gauche de 13.5 cm de grand axe à développement exorénal hétérogène se rehaussant après injection du produit de contraste (PDC), évoquant en premier un carcinome rénal associée à une infiltration de la graisse péri rénale avec des ganglions lombo-aortiques gauches d'allure suspecte et absence de localisation secondaire hépatique ou pulmonaire. Le patient a été opéré il a eu une néphrectomie totale élargie réalisée par voie sous costale avec des suites post-opératoires simples et un court séjour hospitalier de 5 jours. L’étude anatomopathologique de la pièce opératoire a trouvé une tumeur largement nécrosée qui comporte des zones charnues de couleur blanc grisâtre et indurées. Cette tumeur infiltre le sinus. A l’étude microscopique les cellules tumorales sont de grande taille, de forme variable, tantôt d'aspect épithélioide et tantôt d'aspect rabdoide. De nombreuses figures de mitoses atypiques (6 mitoses/ 10GC) sont observées ainsi que la présence de nombreux embols tumoraux. La nécrose tumorale est estimée à 20%. L’étude immuno-histochimique sur la coupe de parrafine était positive pour EMA, HMB45 et Mélan A. Toutes ces constations ont permis de confirmer le diagnostic d'angiomyolipome épithéloide monophasique ou pécome malin classé pT2 N1 M0. Le suivi post-opératoire à 3 mois, trouve un patient en bon état général, asymptomatique avec une fonction rénale normale.

CR_FRE_190,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d'un jeune garçon de 18 ans, 3ème d'une fratrie de 5, issu d'un mariage non consanguin, référé d'un centre d'hémodialyse privé pour prise en charge de douleurs osseuses avec altération de l’état général et syndrome tumoral. Le patient avait un long passé de lithiases rénales récidivantes depuis l’âge de 6 ans traitées par lithotripsie à plusieurs reprises sans bilan étiologique. Il a été mis en hémodialyse en 2008 pour IRCT sur néphropathie interstitielle d'origine lithiasique. L’évolution en hémodialyse a été marquée par l'apparition d'une anémie résistante à l’érythropoïétine pour laquelle il a été multitransfusé. 6 mois avant son admission, le malade avait présenté des douleurs osseuses des membres et du rachis d'installation progressive avec arthralgies inflammatoires des épaules, coudes, poignets et genoux. La symptomatologie s'est aggravée 2 mois avant l'hospitalisation par accentuation des douleurs devenues permanentes, aggravées lors des séances d'hémodialyse, entrainant une impotence fonctionnelle avec apparition de douleurs thoraciques et d'une dyspnée de repos sans toux ni hémoptysie évoluant dans un contexte de sensations fébriles et d'altération profonde de l’état général. Un traitement antibacillaire d’épreuve avait été démarré par le néphrologue référant après bilan radiologique pour tuberculose pleuropulmonaire arrêté après un mois devant la non amélioration.
A l'admission, le patient était conscient, altéré, pâle, fébrile à 38°C, tachycarde à 140 battements/min, hypertendu à 160/90 mmHg avec des oedèmes blancs des 2 membres inférieurs. L'examen ostéoarticulaire avait objectivé une douleur à la palpation des différents segments osseux au niveau des membres, côtes et épineuses rachidiennes. L'examen cardiovasculaire avait mis en évidence une diminution des bruits du cœur à l'auscultation et l'examen pleuropulmonaire un syndrome d’épanchement liquidien basithoracique gauche. Une splénomégalie homogène a été retrouvée à l'examen abdominal avec une matité à la percussion et l'examen des aires ganglionnaires avait mis en évidence une adénopathie axillaire gauche de 2cm/1cm ferme mobile avec de multiples ganglions lenticulaires au niveau jugulaire et inguinal.
Le bilan radiologique avait objectivé de multiples images lytiques lacunaires et condensantes au niveau des poignets et des mains avec une cardiomégalie associée à une pleurésie et des petits reins calcifiés à l'AUSP . L’échographie et la TDM abdominales avaient mis en évidence une ascite de moyenne abondance avec splénomégalie homogène sans adénopathies profondes. L’échocardiographie avait retrouvé une hypertrophie ventriculaire gauche concentrique avec hypokinésie septale, dysfonction légère du VG (fraction d’éjection à 43%), forte HTAp (72 mmHg) et épanchement péricardique circonférentiel avec invagination de l'oreillette droite ce qui avait nécessité un drainage chirurgical en urgence qui avait ramené 1 litre de liquide jaune citrin transsudatif à l’étude chimique.
Sur le plan biologique, notre malade avait une anémie normochrome normocytaire à 7.2 g/dl, avec frottis sans particularité. La ferritine était à 1129 μg/l et les LDH à 426 UI/L. Cette anémie était résistante à l’érythropoïétine ce qui avait nécessité des transfusions multiples, avec un syndrome inflammatoire: VS à 130mm et augmentation des alpha 2 globulines à l’électrophorèse des protéines sériques. Le bilan phosphocalcique avait objectivé une calcémie spontanément normale à 97 mg/l avec hyperphosphorémie à 83 mg/l et hypoparathyroïdie à 74, 85 pg/ml. Les PAL étaient à 136 UI/L, l'aluminium sérique à 13μg/l et la Vitamine D native à 20, 87 ng/ml.
Une biopsie ganglionnaire a été faite au niveau axillaire et qui avait objectivé une adénite chronique réactionnelle, la biopsie péricardique avait mis en évidence un péricarde dystrophique sans signes de malignité et la biopsie ostéomédullaire était en faveur d'une hyperoxalurie avec dépôts de cristaux d'oxalate de calcium, fibrose médullaire et réaction macrophagique à corps étranger . L’évolution a été marquée par la survenue de fractures spontanées à répétition au niveau de l’épaule (Figure 5) et des 2 hanches traitées d'un côté par prothèse.","

CR_FRE_192,French,"K.U, âgé de 3 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques, était victime d'un AE par contact direct avec un câble électrique de distribution domestique (220 volts) qui trainait par terre. Ce contact avait projeté l'enfant avec une chute d'une hauteur estimée à 3 mètres, avec notion de perte de connaissance initiale, sans signe d'hémorragie extériorisée. Le patient sera acheminé dans un centre hospitalier où il sera pris en charge en urgence. Quatre mois après l'AE, l'enfant a présenté un trouble de comportement fait de refus de manger, de mélanger la nourriture avec la boue, de refus de communiquer par moment, d'hurlement sans aucune motivation, de nervosité exagérée et d'agressivité avec passage à l'acte. L'examen neuropsychiatrique avait mis en évidence une aphasie motrice, une marche ébrieuse, une agitation psychomotrice et une instabilité. Sur le plan somatique, l'examen avait objectivé des cicatrices de brûlures cutanées siégeant au niveau de la face interne des doigts (index, majeur et annulaire) et celle du pied droit. Aucune lésion cutanée n'avait été objectivée au niveau du crâne. Nous avons conclu à un syndrome cérébelleux associé à un EAPM post AE. Le scanner cérébral avait montré un élargissement du quatrième ventricule et des citernes de base en faveur d'une atrophie de l'angle ponto-cérébelleux . Le tracé d’électroencéphalogramme (EEG) était perturbé par l'abondance en éléments lents diffus. L’électrocardiogramme (ECG) était normal. Le patient avait reçu un traitement fait de rispéridone (1mg deux fois par jour pendant 2 semaines), de chlorpromazine (25mg deux fois par jour pendant 3 jours) et de piracétam (400 mg trois fois par jour pendant deux mois). L’évolution était marquée par une stabilité psychomotrice, une reprise progressive du langage (de l'aphasie vers un langage normal en passant par la dysarthrie) et une marche normale.","

CR_FRE_193,French,"Il s'agit d'une patiente de 35 ans, sans antécédent pathologique particulier connu, admise en réanimation pour suspicion d'embolie pulmonaire. Elle avait été admise aux urgences chirurgicales 20 jours plus tôt, pour fracture isolée des plateaux tibiaux droits traitée par un plâtre circulaire cruro-pédieux, sans anticoagulation préventive. L’évolution a été marquée deux semaines plus tard, par la survenue de douleur du membre associée à une tuméfaction ayant motivé l'ablation du plâtre. Une immobilisation par attelle a été alors réalisée. La patiente n'a pas non plus été mise sous anticoagulant. Une semaine plus tard, devant l'apparition de douleurs basithoraciques droites d'intensité croissante accompagnées de dyspnée et de fièvre, elle a été hospitalisée dans une structure privée pendant deux jours avant d’être transférée en réanimation après un traitement à base de paracétamol, métamisole et ceftriaxone. A l'entrée en réanimation, elle a bénéficié d'une oxygénothérapie, une anticoagulation à dose curative (Enoxaparine 4000 UI 2 fois /jour), une analgésie (Paracétamol et Tramadol) et une antibiothérapie (Amoxicilline-Acide clavulanique). Le bilan à l'admission a permis de suspecter une embolie pulmonaire devant: une élévation des D-Dimères (3547, 94 ng/ml), une opacité dense homogène sans bronchogramme aérien occupant le tiers inferieur du champ pulmonaire droit à la radiographie pulmonaire et un aspect S1Q3T3 à l'ECG. L'angioscanner thoracique réalisé au deuxième jour d'hospitalisation a confirmé l'embolie pulmonaire. L’échodoppler veineux du membre inférieur droit a mis en évidence une thrombose veineuse profonde de la fémorale superficielle.
Le diagnostic d'embolie pulmonaire compliquant une thrombophlébite du membre pelvien droit a alors été retenue. L'héparinothérapie avec l'enoxaparine a été poursuivie associée au Fluindione 20 mg/jour. L'arrêt de l'enoxaparine est décidé au cinquième jour de l'association enoxaparine-fluindione (INR à 2, 10). Au sixième jour d'anticoagulation par le Fluindione seul, il est apparu une douleur à l'hypocondre droit à type de pesanteur inhibant l'inspiration profonde. Une échographie abdominale réalisée a objectivé un important hématome extra capsulaire du foie. La patiente a présenté un état de choc hémorragique au septième jour. A l'hémogramme on retrouvait une déglobulisation (hémoglobine à 8, 4 g/dL, contre 11, 6 g/dL la veille), le bilan de la coagulation était normal (INR à 2, 84). Un remplissage vasculaire a été fait (500 mL de macromolécule) associé à une transfusion sanguine (deux poches de concentré de globule rouge) et de 3 poches de plasma frais congelé (PFC). L'arrêt de la fluindione a aussi été décidé. Devant la persistance de l'anémie malgré une transfusion itérative (6 poches de concentré de globule rouge en cinq jours), une tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdominale réalisée a objectivé un énorme hématome extracapsulaire du foie et un hémopéritoine de grande abondance. La laparotomie réalisée 48 heures après le diagnostic, a mis en évidence un hémopéritoine de 2, 5 L, un important hématome du méso de l'angle colique droit et du colon transverse de 16 cm de grand axe. Les suites opératoires ont été simples.","

CR_FRE_195,French,"Nous rapportons un cas rare d′abcès thyroïdien à Escherichia coli survenu chez une patiente de 55 ans, immunodéprimée: diabétique insulinodépendante non équilibrée, hypertendue mal suivie avec insuffisance cardiaque gauche, et en insuffisance rénale chronique terminale. Elle n’avait aucun antécédent de pathologie thyroïdienne sous-jacente. La patiente s’est présentée aux urgences avec une tuméfaction basi-cervicale antérieure évoluant sur 10 jours. Les premiers symptômes étaient: gène à la déglutition, asthénie et une difficulté à respirer mise sur le compte de son insuffisance cardiaque. La symptomatologie s’est aggravée au fil des jours, avec apparition d’une tuméfaction cervicale antérieure augmentant progressivement de taille, associée à une dyspnée aggravée au décubitus, une aphagie, dans un contexte d ‘altération de l’état général et de fièvre.
L’examen physique a trouvé une masse cervicale basse médiane, prédominante à droite, mesurant 6 cm de grand axe, tendue et rénitente, très douloureuse à la palpation, inflammatoire, mobile à la déglutition, avec une dyspnée mixte, sueurs et fièvre chiffrée à 39°C. Un bilan biologique réalisé en premier a montré des perturbations biologiques importantes: La glycémie à jeun était à 3, 9g/l avec de l’acétone dans les urines témoignant d’une cétose diabétique. La glycémie à jeun était à 6, 26g/l avec de l’acétone dans les urines témoignant d’une cétose diabétique. L’urée était à 1, 18 g/l, la créatininémie à 33mg/l, la kaliémie était élevée à 7, 04mmol/l, le sodium à 132mmol/l.
L’hémograrmme a objectivé une anémie à 7, 8g/dL, une hyperleucocytose à 26, 3x103/uL. Un prélèvement pour dosage de la TSHµs et des hormones thyroïdiennes a été effectué. La correction des troubles étant entreprise en urgence en milieu de réanimation, un scanner cervico-thoracique, a été demandé en urgence, objectivant un énorme processus du lobe thyroïdien droit à contenu liquidien de 9cm, avec effet de masse sur les voies aérodigestifs supérieures, et refoulant l’axe jugulo-carotidien droit latéralement. Une thrombose de la veine jugulaire droite a été mise en évidence. L’infiltration des parties molles pré vertébrales et cervicales était importante.
Le diagnostic d’abcès de la thyroïde était évoqué, à côté d’une tumeur thyroïdienne nécrosée. La cytoponction à l′aiguille a ramenée 10 ml de liquide purulent jaunâtre a permis de confirmer le diagnostic d’abcès thyroidien.
Le drainage chirurgical a été décidé. L’intervention a été réalisé sous anesthésie locale vue le risque d’intubation difficile devant le blindage cervical et en présence d’une trachée profonde difficilement accessible (trachéotomie difficile). Le drainage a permis d’évacuer 100 ml de pus. L’amélioration de la dyspnée était précoce dès la fin de l’intervention.
E. coli a été isolée après la culture du liquide de drainage. La patiente était porteuse d’un bricker depuis l’enfance pour une malformation de la vessie (non documentée). Ceci suggère une bactériémie à point de départ urinaire, avec embole septique au niveau de la glande thyroïde. Un ECBU réalisé après avoir démarré l’antibiothérapie probabiliste est revenu stérile, mais avec la présence d’un nombre significativement élevé de leucocytes altérées témoignant d’une infection en cours. L’hémoculture est revenue stérile. Le bilan hormonal était normal.
L’évolution était bonne sous tri-antibiothérapie première à base de céftriaxone 2 g/j+ flgyl 2g/j +gentamycine 160mg/j, secondairement adaptée à l’antibiogramme: le germe était sensible à la céftriaxone et à la gentamycine. Des pansements biquotidiens ont été réalisée pendant 2 semaines en hospitalisation et 1 semaine en ambulatoire jusqu’à tarissement de l’infection. L’équilibration du diabète et des troubles hydro-éléctrolytiques n’a été obtenue qu’après 7 jours du drainage chirurgical.","

CR_FRE_196,French,"Patiente âgée de 74 ans, diabétique, hypertendue sous traitement médical, avec une longue histoire de constipation chronique qui avait consulté pour des douleurs abdominales depuis 4 jours. Il n′y avait pas de nausée, pas de vomissement et pas d′arrêt des matières et des gaz. La température était à 38, 5 °C. Sur le plan hémodynamique, il y avait une tendance au collapsus. La palpation abdominale avait trouvé une défense abdominale généralisée à maximum au niveau de la fosse iliaque gauche et hypogastrique. Le toucher rectal avait provoqué des douleurs dans le cul-de-sac de Douglas sans masse palpable. Sur le plan biologique, il existait un syndrome infectieux et inflammatoire avec 22 000 leucocytes/mL et une CRP à 345 mg/L. La radiographie de l′abdomen sans préparation n'avait pas montré de niveau hydroaérique ou de pneumopéritoine. Le scanner abdominopelvien avait objectivé un épanchement péritonéal modéré, associé à une importante infiltration péritonéale sans pneumopéritoine ni abcès profond. La patiente a été mise sous antibiothérapie (Claforan+ Flagyl+ Genta) et opérée par une laparotomie médiane après une brève réanimation. L′exploration de la cavité péritonéale avait mis en évidence une péritonite généralisée avancée avec présence de fausses membranes et d′un liquide purulent, prélevé pour examen bactériologique. Il a été constaté une perforation de la face antérieure de la charnière recto-sigmoïdienne, sur le bord antimésentérique, avec un fécalome très dur impacté dans celle-ci. Après une toilette péritonéale abondante, il lui a été réalisé une intervention de Hartmann avec une résection du colon perforé, une fermeture du moignon rectal, et abouchement du colon proximal en stomie. L'intervention s'est terminée par un drainage de la cavité péritonéale. La pièce opératoire était envoyée pour examen anatomopathologique. Les suites étaient marquées par un état de choc septique résistant aboutissant au décès de la patiente à J 2 postopératoire. L′examen anatomopathologique de la pièce opératoire n'avait pas montré de tumeur, de pathologie inflammatoire colique, de diverticulose, ni de lésion ischémique.","

CR_FRE_197,French,"Il s’agit d’un nourrisson de sexe féminin âgé de 35 jours reçu en urgence pédiatrique pour une difficulté respiratoire évoluant depuis 24 heures accompagnée d’un geignement et d’une toux. On ne notait pas de fièvre ni de diarrhée. La mère âgée est âgée de 18 ans primipare et primigeste. Le déroulement de la grossesse était sans particularité. L’accouchement à terme 38 semaine d’aménorrhée était eutocique par voie basse avec un Apgar = 10 à la première minute. Le poids de naissance était de 3300 g. On ne notait pas de tare familiale. L’examen du nourrisson relevait une polypnée superficielle avec un score de Silverman = 4 : un balancement thoraco-abdominal, un battement des ailes du nez et un geignement. Il n’y avait pas de cyanose et la SpO2 à l’air libre était à 96%. Les champs pulmonaires étaient libres et l’auscultation cardiaque relevait une tachycardie régulière très rapide à 250 minutes. L’abdomen était souple avec la présence d’une hépatomégalie homogène avec une flèche hépatique = 14 cm sur la ligne médio claviculaire. Les mensurations pour l’âge étaient normale avec un périmètre crânien = 38cm; un périmètre brachial = 13 cm; un poids= 4700 g; une taille= 62 cm. Un électrocardiogramme (ECG) standard à 12 dérivations relevait une tachycardie régulière à QRS large avec une fréquence ventriculaire de 300/minutes . L’échographie Doppler cardiaque montrait un cœur très rapide avec une minime insuffisance mitrale et une légère dilatation de l’oreillette gauche sans autres anomalies. La radiographie thoracique montrait une cardiomégalie modérée avec un rapport cardio- thoracique = 0.65. Le bilan biologique effectué retrouvait : une hyperleucocytose à 18130/mm3 à prédominance de polynucléaire neutrophile, une anémie avec un taux d’hémoglobine à 10, 2g/dl normochrome normocytaire ; la CRP normale <6 mg, un ionogramme sanguin normal. Au total: il s’agissait d’une défaillance cardiaque aigue sur tachycardie.
Au plan thérapeutique une dose charge d’Amiodarone à la dose de 10 mg/Kg n’a pas permis de réduire cette tachycardie. La patiente à reçu également du Furosémide à la dose 2mg/Kg/jour et du Ceftriaxone à la dose 75 mg/Kg/jour. Le lendemain, devant la persistance des signes d’insuffisance cardiaque, une cardioversion électrique par un défibrillateur externe semi-automatique type Lifeline adulte est effectuée avec un retour à un rythme sinusal stable suivie d’une nette amélioration marquée par la régression immédiate de la dyspnée et de l’hépatomégalie en quelques jours. Sur le tracé ECG en rythme sinusal, on pouvait voir un aspect de PR court avec onde delta permettant d’évoquer les diagnostics suivants : une tachycardie antidromique sur Wolf Parkinson White (WPW) postéro septal gauche, une tachycardie ventriculaire et une tachycardie supra ventriculaire avec aberration de conduction. La mise en exéat est faite avec un maintient de l’Amiodarone en traitement d’entretien à la dose de 5mg/Kg/j.","

L’examen clinique trouve une patiente cachectique, abdomen très distendu. L’examen des sein a trouvé 2 nodules (l’ un au niveau de la jonction des quadrans inferieurs du sein droit faisant 2cm et l’ autre au niveau du quadran supéro interne du sein gauche faisant 1 cm) à contours polylobés, de consistance ferme et mobiles par rapport au 2 plans, avec des adénopathies axillaires gauches et susclaviculaires. Le toucher rectal a objectivé un aspect induré de la face antérieure du rectum. L’exploration pelvienne par l’échographie complétée par l’IRM a trouvé une grossesse intra-utérine évolutive de 32 SA, avec une ascite de grande abondance et 2 tumeurs latéro-utérines droite et gauches mesurant respectivement 86 cm et 98cm de grand axe, évoquant une tumeur de krukenberg bilatérale avec des signes de carcinose péritonéale qui au niveau du douglas, se continue avec l’induration rectale. L’origine rectale a été évoquée d’autant plus que la patiente n’a pas rapporté de signe digestif haut. Cependant, la biopsie rectale s’est révélée négative. Par ailleurs, L’échographie hépatique était normale et la TDM thoracique a trouvé des lésions ostéo-condensantes en faveur de localisations secondaires avec sur la NFS une bicytopénie. L’échographie mammaire a classé les nodules palpables ACR 4 et a objectivé 2 autres lésions infra-cliniques droites (6 et 7 mm) classées ACR 4. Après discussion du cas en réunion de concertation multidisciplinaire, on a réalisé une césarienne (après corticothérapie pour maturation pulmonaire fœtale) avec une annexectomie diagnostique bilatérale . L’exploration per opératoire a trouvé un nodule péritonéal du douglas, un épiploon d’allure tumorale, un estomac tumoral et le geste a été complété par des biopsies multiples. A la fin de l’intervention, une biopsie des 2 nodules mammaires palpables a été réalisée. L’étude histologique a conclue à une localisation mammaire, ovarienne, péritonéale, et épiploique, d’un adénocarcinome digestif dont les cellules expriment franchement le CK20 et faiblement le CK7 à noter que celles d’origine mammaires n’expriment pas les récepteurs oestrogéniques et progestéroniques avec un témoin interne négatif.
A J 3 de la césarienne, la fibroscopie avec biopsie de la tumeur a été faite. Et l’histologie du processus gastrique a trouvé un adénocarcinome gastrique peu différencié dont les cellules expriment la CK et n’expriment pas le CD20. Cependant la patiente est sortie contre avis médical quelques jours après la césarienne.","

CR_FRE_200,French,"Présentation du patient: il s'agit d'un patient de 65 ans, sans antécédent, ayant présenté durant 4 mois une dysurie avec pollakiurie qui s'est compliquée d'une rétention urinaire aigue, motivant une consultation aux urgences.
Résultats cliniques: l'examen clinique a retrouvé un patient en bon état général, présentant un globe vésical douloureux et une volumineuse masse prostatique ferme et homogène au touché rectal. Le reste de l'examen était sans particularité notamment l'exploration des aires ganglionnaires superficielles. Devant ce tableau clinique une échographie abdomino-pelvienne, un bilan standard et un dosage du taux de PSA ont été réalisés en urgence.
Démarche diagnostique: l'exploration échographique abdomino-pelvienne réalisée n'a retrouvé que des signes évocateurs d'une hyperplasie bénigne prostatique (HBP) simple sans mise en évidence d'hydronéphrose, d'adénopathie ou d'hépato-splénomégalie. Le dosage du taux de PSA était normal et le reste du bilan standard et préopératoire étaient sans particularité.
Intervention thérapeutique: devant ce tableau de rétention urinaire aigue sur HBP, le patient a bénéficié d'un sondage urinaire afin de le soulager dans l'immédiat suivi par la suite d'une résection prostatique endoscopique transurétrale permettant un traitement au long terme. Les suites opératoires étaient simples avec amélioration de la symptomatologie.
Résultat et suivi: à notre grande surprise l'étude histologique des copeaux de résection prostatiques adressés a mis en évidence un parenchyme prostatique largement infiltré par des coulées de lymphocytes de petite taille, d'aspect monocytoïde et centrocytique, montrant par places des images de lymphocytose et de destructions lympho-épithéliales . Ces éléments étaient de phénotype B: CD20+, CD79a+, CD3-, CD5-, CD23-, Cycline-D1- et CD10- avec un faible indice de prolifération Ki67, estimé à 1% . Ainsi, le diagnostic d'un lymphome prostatique à petites cellules B de la zone marginale extra-ganglionnaire de type MALT a été posé.
Le bilan d'extension a retrouvé un discret amaigrissement récent, des adénopathies cervicales, iliaques et une hépato-splénomégalie minimes; un taux des LDH modérément élevé, un pic monoclonal kappa et une lymphocytose sanguine sans infiltration médullaire dont le profil en cytométrie de flux était similaire à celui de l'infiltrat prostatique, classant ainsi ce lymphome en lymphome prostatique de la zone marginale (type MALT) de stade IV-B d´Ann Arbor en conversion leucémique. Le bilan virologique a mis en évidence par ailleurs, une hépatite B chronique active concomitante. Le patient a bénéficié d'une polychimiothérapie de type R-CHOP ayant permis une rémission complète à 3 mois avec normalisation des LDH et une survie sans rechute à 18 mois.
Consentement éclairé: après des explications claires et détaillées, le patient a donné son consentement éclairé vu qu'il est majeur pour la réalisation de ce travail.","

CR_FRE_202,French,"Nous rapportons le cas d'un patient âgé 24ans, soldat très actif, musclé et sportif, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, s'est présenté à la consultation pour des douleurs scapulaires gauches d'allure inflammatoire, évoluant depuis 6 mois. Il avait également constaté depuis 3 mois, la perte de l'abduction et de l'antépulsion de l’épaule gauche au delà de 90°, son entourage ayant noté par ailleurs l'apparition d'une déformation manifeste sur la face postérieure de son épaule gauche, lorsqu'il effectuait des mouvements d'abduction et d'antépulsion. A l'inspection du dos on a constaté le décollement de l'omoplate provoqué par le patient, ce décollement s'exagère lorsqu'on demande au patient d'effectuer des pompes contre le mur . L'examen clinique a objectivé une limitation de l'antépulsion et l'abduction à 90°. Devant cet aspect clinique conforté par notre expérience précédente, nous avons soulevé voire posé le diagnostic de winging scapula, par paralysie du nerf thoracique long, que l'on a allégué chez le patient aux exercices physiques intensifs.
Afin de confirmer ce diagnostic, un bilan complémentaire a été demandé comportant un électromyogramme ayant conclu à une conduction nerveuse dans les limites de la normale, la détection musculaire objectivant un tracé comportant une activité neurogène critique dans les territoires C5- C6 ou tronc primaire. Ce résultat peu contributif, abondait néanmoins dans le sens du diagnostic de winging scapula. Le bilan radiologique standard a consisté en une radiographie de l'omoplate gauche de face et de profil, une radiographie thoracique ainsi que des radiographies du rachis cervical de face, de profil et de ¾, lequel bilan s'est révélé normal. L'avis des confrères neurologues et internistes, ainsi que le bilan biologique, permettait d’éliminer une pathologie générale dans le cadre de laquelle s'inscrirait la paralysie du nerf thoracique long. Devant les résultats de l'examen clinique, du bilan paraclinique, conforté par l'avis des confrères spécialistes, on a retenu le diagnostic de winging scapula par paralysie du nerf thoracique long en rapport avec les microtraumatismes répétés lors des exercices physiques et de musculation intensifs. Un traitement fonctionnel premier a été décidé, et le patient a été confié au kinésithérapeute. Il a ainsi bénéficié de 50 séances de rééducation étalées sur 06 mois. Au 6ème mois, l'examen clinique est resté inchangé, la douleur était aussi intense, bien qu'elle céda légèrement aux antalgiques et aux anti-inflammatoires non stéroïdiens sans jamais disparaitre complètement. Devant la douleur gênante et insomniante, l'handicap fonctionnel de plus en plus pesant et la gêne esthétique de plus en plus dérangeante, l'indication du traitement chirurgical a été retenue. Vu que le patient était jeune, qu'il avait une musculature particulièrement bien développée, et qu'il avait consulté tôt, permettant d’éliminer ainsi le risque de dégénérescence graisseuse de ses muscles; un traitement conservateur par stabilisation dynamique de la scapula lui a été proposé et nous avons opté pour la technique de transfert du tendon du grand pectoral rallongé par une bandelette du fascia-lata.","

La grossesse était suivie avec 5 consultations prénatales et une échographie obstétricale ayant diagnostiqué la grossesse gémellaire sans plus d'informations. A l'admission, l'examen clinique retrouvait un bon état général, des muqueuses colorées. La hauteur utérine était de 42 cm. La palpation de la région sus pubienne était imprécise à cause d'une contracture utérine généralisée. Les bruits du cœur fœtal n’étaient pas perçus. L'examen vulvo-périnéal mettait en évidence un pôle céphalique accolé à la vulve associé à la procidence du cordon ombilical et de deux mains non symétriques.

CR_FRE_205,French,"Mr Z.M âgé de 40 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques particuliers, a présenté deux mois avant la consultation, un syndrome d'insuffisance médullaire complet. Le bilan biologique objectivait une pancytopénie avec une anémie normochrome normocytaire à 9.6g/dl arégénérative avec un taux de réticulocytes à 20000/ mm3, une leucopénie à 700/mm3, une lymphopénie à 546/mm3 et une thrombopénie à 3000/mm3. La biopsie médullaire mettait en évidence une moelle désertique adipeuse concluant à une aplasie médullaire. Le bilan étiologique était négatif concluant à une aplasie médullaire sévère idiopathique. Les sérologies VIH, hépatite B et C étaient négatives. Le patient était traité par Sérum antilymphocytaire (SAL) pendant 5 jours avec ciclosporine à la dose de 6mg/kg/j. Six mois après le début du SAL, le patient avait présenté une dyspnée avec une toux sèche évoluant dans un contexte d'apyrexie avec l'apparition de lésions cutanées diffuses. L'examen clinique objectivait des lésions angiomateuses violacées au niveau des membres évocatrices de MK. L'histologie cutanée était en faveur d'une MK avec une prolifération vasculaire faite de cellules fusiformes localisées. Au niveau dermique, se trouvaient des vaisseaux irréguliers de petites tailles bordées d'un endothélium. Un infiltrat inflammatoire lympho-plasmocytaire périvasculaire avec un dépôt d'hémosidérine était associé . L'immunomarquage au niveau de la peau par les anticorps anti-HHV8 montrait un marquage nucléaire franc et intense de plus de 70% des cellules kaposiennes. La sérologie HHV8 au niveau du sang n'avait pas été réalisée. La radiographie pulmonaire montrait des opacités macro-nodulaires diffuses au niveau des deux champs pulmonaires . Le scanner thoracique objectivait un syndrome alvéolaire diffus en ailes de papillon compatible avec un oedème lésionnel organisé . L’échographie abdominale ainsi que la fibroscopie oeso-gatro-duodénale n'avaient pas retrouvé d'autres localisations viscérales.
Les lésions cutanées s’étaient rapidement étendues avec une aggravation de la gêne respiratoire et des images pulmonaires. La ciclosporine fut arrêtée et des cures de Bléomycine à 15 mg toutes les deux semaines avaient été entreprises. L’évolution était marquée par une bonne réponse clinique avec la disparition totale des lésions cutanées et pulmonaires après 10 cures de Bléomycine.

CR_FRE_207,French,"Il s´agit d´une patiente de 50 ans, grande multipare, ayant comme antécédents pathologiques une insuffisance cardiaque gauche sur une cardiopathie ischémique stable sous anti-vitamine K et Aspirine, hypertendue bien équilibrée sous traitement anti-hypertenseur et mesures hygiéno-diététiques. Son histoire de la maladie avait commencé par son hospitalisation dans le service de gynécologie pour la prise en charge d´une masse abdomino-pelvienne arrivant jusqu´à l´ombilic faisant 20 cm de grand axe. Une échographie pelvienne réalisée parlait d´un utérus globuleux mesurant 74 mm x 41 mm, l´endomètre était régulier épaissi de 14 mm, une image hétérogène prenait tout l´écran, solido-kystique et hypoéchogène multiloculaire (plus de 6) avec des cloisons dont l´épaisseur est de 3 mm avec vascularisation centrale, en faveur d´une masse solido-kystique suspecte ovarienne. Le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien avait objectivé une volumineuse masse latéro et sus utérine gauche grossièrement ovalaire bien limitée hétérogène à double composante kystique majoritaire contenant des septas épaissies et tissulaire, rehaussée de façon hétérogène après contraste, mesurant 145 mm x 100 mm x 123 mm .
L´hystéroscopie diagnostique avait montré une atrophie endométriale diffuse avec hypertrophie localisée au niveau de la face postérieure sans signes d´atypies, les deux ostiums et l´endocol était sans anomalies. Le curetage n´a pas été fait vue la non disponibilité de la pipelle de Cornier dans le service. Pour les marqueurs tumoraux le CA125=233 U/ml, l´ACE et le CA19-9 étaient normaux. L´inhibine et l’hormone antimüllérienne (AMH) n´ont pas été dosés par manque de réactifs. La laparotomie exploratrice réalisée avait trouvé une ascite de faible abondance prélevée pour cytologie avec découverte d´une masse faisant 30 cm x 40 cm à paroi lisse friable, hypervascularisée à composante hémorragique intra-kystique au dépend de l´ovaire gauche adhérente au sigmoïde du côté gauche, à noter la rupture per-opératoire accidentelle de la portion hémorragique de la masse qui fut protégée par des champs stériles.
Le reste de l´exploration chirurgicale avait objectivé un utérus de taille normale, une trompe gauche et une annexe droite sans anomalies, pas de carcinose péritonéale visible, le foie et l´estomac étaient lisses et il n´y avait pas d´adénopathies palpables. Une annexectomie gauche a été réalisée puis adressée pour un examen extemporané. Ce dernier parlait d´un processus tumoral malin, indifférencié. Puis le geste a été complété par une hystérectomie totale avec une annexectomie droite et des biopsies multiples. Le résultat de l´étude anatomopathologique était en faveur d´un processus carcinomateux avec un liquide péritonéal tumoral. A l´histologie: les différents prélèvements réalisés au niveau de la masse tumorale sus-décrite correspondent à une prolifération tumorale disposée en nappe diffuse, avec parfois des papilles, les cellules tumorales sont bordées par des cellules atypiques de grande taille, munies de noyaux arrondis, à chromatine fine, parfois nucléolés, et entourés d´un cytoplasme abondant éosinophile, avec présence de foyers de nécrose tumorale, des remaniements hémorragiques sont notés .
A l´immunohistochimie: les cellules tumorales expriment la CK7, la calrétinine, focalement l´inhibine, la vimentine, la P53, la CK8/18, la CK19 et la CK20. Elles n´expriment pas le CD30, la PS100, le TTF1, la thyroglobuline, la chromogranine, la synaptophysine, le CD56, la melan A, l´EMA ni la CK5/6. Ce panel oriente vers un mésothéliome ovarien. Un complément d´immunomarquage par le Ber-EP4 a été effectué qui était faiblement positif, en faveur d´un mésothéliome. Nous avons complété également par le WT1 qui est normalement positif dans les carcinomes ovariens, qui est négatif dans notre cas. On a aussi réalisé le TFE3 qui est exprimé par les sarcomes alvéolaires vue la ressemblance morphologique et il était également négatif . L´index de prolifération tumorale évalué par le Ki 67 était estimé à 30%. Au final, le diagnostic de mésothéliome ovarien a été retenu. Le scanner post-opératoire n´avait pas montré de maladie résiduelle et le CA125 est passé à 21.40 U/ml. Sur ces données, la décision était de faire une chimiothérapie adjuvante. Le bilan biologique pré chimiothérapie était correct.
L´échographie cardiaque trans-thoracique avait mis en évidence une insuffisance tricuspidienne et mitrale minimes, un ventricule gauche de taille normale et de fraction d´éjection conservée à 62%. La patiente a été mise sous le protocole de chimiothérapie comportant la Gemcitabine (à j1 et j8) et le Carboplatine AUC 5 (à j1) tous les 21 jours (j1=j21). Le Pemetrexed n´était pas disponible dans notre structure au moment du premier cycle. La patiente avait reçu 6 cures de chimiothérapie, la tolérance était marquée par la survenue d´un épisode de neutropénie non fébrile qu´on a pu gérer par le repos et les mesures hygiéno-diététiques. Le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien d´évaluation après 3 cycles avait confirmé l´absence de masse pelvienne ou de prise de contraste pathologique notamment au niveau de la tranche de section vaginale. Le même constat était retrouvé lors des contrôles scannographiques ultérieures. Actuellement, la patiente est en bon contrôle avec un recul de plus de 12 mois.","

CR_FRE_208,French,"Il s′agissait d′un patient de 32 ans, sans antécédents particuliers. Il a été reçu le 06/08/2012 aux Urgences Chirurgicales pour des douleurs abdominales du flanc gauche d'installation progressive évoluant depuis 06 heures associées à des vomissements. Ces douleurs étaient consécutives à une alimentation importante suite à la rupture du jeûn durant le mois de ramadan. A l'examen, le patient était en état de choc avec une tension artérielle et un pouls imprenables, une hypothermie à 34, 2°C et une polypnée à 36 cycles/min. Les muqueuses conjonctivales étaient pâles. L'abdomen était distendu avec un tympanisme diffus. Il y avait une contracture abdominale avec une crépitation gazeuse au niveau hypogastrique et du flanc gauche. Au toucher rectal, le cul de sac de Douglas était libre et indolore, le doigtier revenait souillé de sang noirâtre. La sonde nasogastrique avait ramené du sang noirâtre. La numération et formule sanguine faite à l'admission avait permis de retrouver un taux d'hémoglobine à 12, 7g/dl et le reste des éléments sanguins était normal. La fonction rénale était altérée avec une créatininémie à 22, 29g/l et un taux d'urée à 0, 47g/l. Le bilan de la coagulation était normal. La numération de contrôle faite 5 heures après son admission avait permis de noter une chute importante du taux d'hémoglobine à 6, 2g/dl. La radiographie de l'abdomen sans préparation avait objectivé un pneumopéritoine massif. Le diagnostic de péritonite par perforation d'organe creux était retenu. Une réanimation préopératoire avait permis de corriger les constantes hémodynamiques avec une tension artérielle à 115/70mmHg et un pouls à 110 pulsations/min. L'exploration par laparotomie médiane xypho-pubienne avait permis de retrouver une issue de 1, 5 l de sang noirâtre mêlé à des débris alimentaires, une dilatation importante de l'estomac arrivant au pelvis et une rupture de l'estomac sur 12 cm au niveau de la petite courbure vers le cardia avec des berges saignantes .

CR_FRE_209,French,"Patient et observation Une patiente âgée de 22 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, était hospitalisée pour exploration d'une hypertension artérielle découverte depuis 6 mois. L'examen physique était sans particularité. A la biologie, il y avait une hypokaliémie à 3, 4 mmol/l et une hyperleucocytose à 12100 éléments/mm3. Devant la notion de troubles vasomoteurs à type de céphalée, palpitations et sueurs, un dosage urinaire des dérivés méthoxylés était pratiqué. Le diagnostic de phéochromocytome était confirmé par un taux de normétanéphrine à 135 fois la normale et un taux de 3-méthoxythyramine à 17 fois la normale. L’échographie abdominale révélait la présence de masses surrénaliennes bilatérales. L'IRM abdominale confirmait la présence de masses au niveau des deux surrénales, bien limitées, en hypersignal T2 et se rehaussant de façon intense après injection de produit de contraste. Ces masses faisaient 6, 2 × 5 cm avec un compartiment nécrotique central à gauche et 2, 1 × 1, 8 cm à droite . Devant cette atteinte bilatérale, une scintigraphie à la MIBG a été pratiquée. Elle a permis de mettre en évidence des foyers d'hyperfixation au niveau des deux loges surrénaliennes . Par ailleurs, il n'existait pas d'autres localisations extrasurrénaliennes. Le diagnostic de phéochromocytome bilatéral était retenu. Une forme sporadique était la plus probable devant l'absence d'antécédents familiaux particuliers. L'enquête à la recherche d'une néoplasie endocrinienne multiple était négative. Une surrénalectomie bilatérale par voie cœlioscopique était pratiquée après équilibrations des chiffres tensionnels. A l'examen anatomopathologique il n'y avait pas de signes de malignité du phéochromocytome. Les suites opératoires étaient simples. L’évolution était favorable sous traitement substitutif par 30mg/j d'hydrocortisone. Avec un recul évolutif de 6 ans, aucune récidive n'a été observée.","

Il n’a pas de facteurs de risque cardiovasculaires. 7 ans avant son admission, le patient accusait une surdité bilatérale progressive avec des paresthésies des extrémités, compliqué quelques années par la suite d’une hémiparésie droite négligé par le patient et son entourage. Le traitement à l’admission consiste en la prise de furosémide 40 mg (IVD) 3 fois par jour, spironolactone 25mg, cardiensiel 5mg et sintrom 4mg.
A l’examen clinique, le poids est de 90 kg pour une taille de 1, 80 m. Le pouls est irrégulier aux environs de 110 battements par minute. La pression artérielle est de 140/70 mmHg. A l’auscultation, les bruits cardiaques sont assourdis et irrégulier avec souffle d’IT, râles sous crépitants de stase. Il existe des œdèmes jusqu’à mollet, prenant le godet, avec ascite et hépatomégalie, reflux hépato-jugulaire. L’examen clinique note par ailleurs une hémiparésie droite et une hypoacousie bilatérale.
L’ECG confirme la présence d’une fibrillation auriculaire avec une réponse ventriculaire rapide associée à un aspect d’ischémie sous-épicardique dans le territoire latéral. La radiographie pulmonaire montre une cardiomégalie avec débord droit et HTAP. TDM cérébral en faveur d’un foyer d’ischémie cérébral ancien. Sur le plan biologique, on notait une insuffisance rénale modérée (clairance de la créatinine à 40 mL/min), une protéinurie minime (0, 21 g/24 h), un bilan hépatique perturbée et une élévation du NT-pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proB-NP) à 3 989 ng/L (N < 300 ngL). La troponine-T étaient normal. l La sérologie du virus de l’immunodéficience humaine (VIH) était négative. L’électrophorèse des protéines est normale.

On note une artialisation du ventricule droit secondaire à une IT importantes sur prolapsus de la valve septale entrainant un hiatus de 14 mm, on note également une IM minime sur une valve épaissie. La fonction diastolique était anormale avec un profil transmitral de type « pseudo-normal » (E/A = 1, 2, E/E’ = 15) en faveur d’une élévation des pressions télédiastoliques du ventricule gauche. Il y avait une élévation de la pression artérielle pulmonaire systolique à partir d’un flux d’insuffisance tricuspide laminaire. Il n’y avait pas d’anomalie des autres valves cardiaques ou d’aspect évocateur de fibrose endomyocardique. Enfin, il y avait un épanchement péricardique de moyenne abondance (11 mm) en regard de la paroi postérieure et de l’oreillette droite.

Démarche diagnostique: une tomodensitométrie thoracique avait par la suite été réalisée, ayant permis de mettre en évidence une masse médiastinale antérieure, de densité tissulaire, développée aux dépens du thymus, avec comme mensurations 56 mm x 52 mm de grand axe. Elle exerçait un effet de masse sur le parenchyme pulmonaire gauche et droit .
Afin d´exclure parmi les diagnostics différentiels une tumeur germinale non séminomateuse, les dosages de l´hormone gonadotrophine chorionique humaine, ainsi que l´alpha-fœto-protéine ont été effectués, et sont tous revenus normaux. Le dosage des lactate deshydrogénase (LDH) avait également été effectué et était également revenu normal. Celui des anticorps anti-récepteurs de l´acétylcholine n´avait par contre pas été réalisé du fait des difficultés financières de la famille du patient. Sur la base de ces éléments cliniques et paracliniques, le diagnostic d´une tumeur épithéliale thymique a été évoqué. Nous ne pouvions formellement exclure d´autres diagnostics différentiels tels qu´un lymphome, ou un séminome qu´après une confirmation anatomopathologique de cette tumeur, à la suite de l´exploration chirurgicale de cette masse, qui nous a semblé du reste extirpable au vu des images tomodensitométriques. Les différentes investigations réalisées pour exclure les diagnostics différentiels sont résumées dans le .
Intervention thérapeutique: après prélèvement du bilan biologique pré-opératoire, l´indication opératoire d´une thymectomie radicale par sternotomie médiane a été posée. L´exploration per-opératoire avait révélé une masse thymique souple, non hémorragique, et homogène, d´environ 50 grammes. Elle mesurait 9 x 5 x 3 cm, et adhérait au plan profond. Elle était en rapport avec le péricarde, la plèvre médiastinale droite, et gauche, la veine cave supérieure, et le tronc veineux brachio-céphalique droit qu´elle engainait sur sa face antérieure, avec un plan de clivage . Il avait par conséquent été réalisé comme geste une exérèse du thymus ainsi qu´une portion des franges péricardiques et de la graisse thymique. Les nerfs phréniques droit et gauche avaient été vus et respectés, et la loge thymique totalement évidée . L´ouverture accidentelle des deux plèvres droite et gauche était survenue comme incident per-opératoire. Elle avait motivé la fermeture de la cavité thoracique sous trois drains thoraciques, dont un rétro-sternal et deux pleuraux.
Suivi et résultats: les suites opératoires ont été simples, et le séjour en hospitalisation a été de 8 jours. Il a été observé une nette amélioration de l´état clinique du malade avec une régression complète de la détresse respiratoire. Les radiographies de contrôle à M3 et M6 post-opératoire sont toutes revenues normales. Les résultats de l´examen anatomopathologique sont revenus en faveur d´une hyperplasie thymique. Un suivi annuel lui a été prescrit.

CR_FRE_214,French,"Un jeune adolescent de 12 ans avait été emmené en consultation pour un rendez-vous post opératoire, présentant une douleur de la hanche gauche évoluant depuis 3 mois et une légère boiterie du même côté. Huit mois plutôt, il avait été emmené aux urgences pour douleur de la hanche droite évoluant depuis trois jours. L’examen à l’entrée avait révélé un indice de masse corporelle de 28kg/m2 (poids 80, 6kg; taille, 170cm); un signe de Drehmann positif (rotation externe passive et automatique de la hanche lors de sa flexion), une absence de limitation de la mobilité des hanches, pas d’altération des signes généraux, pas d’impotence fonctionnelle, état hémodynamique stable. La biologie était normale. Le bilan paraclinique avait permis de noter à la radiographie une épiphysiolyse fémorale supérieure aigue droite de type II (angle de Southwick = 32°). Sur la hanche controlatérale «saine», l’angle de Southwick était de 15°, l’angle d’inclinaison postérieure était de 14, 5°, le score d’Oxford modifié était de 19 sur 48, l’angle alpha était de 51° . Après un bilan préopératoire et une consultation préanesthésique, les différentes options thérapeutiques ont été présentées au patient et à la famille, qui ont accepté le traitement chirurgical prophylactique de la hanche controlatérale (gauche) «normale» initialement.
La chirurgie a été réalisée avec le patient positionné sur une table orthopédique, sans exercer de traction, car cette dernière est associée à des risques de nécrose . La procédure opératoire a été réalisée par voie percutanée avec l’utilisation d’un amplificateur de brillance. Sur les deux fémurs, une broche filetée de 2, 5mm a été insérée dans le col sous scopie, puis nous avons utilisé un moteur électrique avec mèche canulée de 5mm, sur un guide-mèche, puis le vissage a été réalisé par des vis canulées de 7, 3mm de diamètre de part et d’autre. Au fémur droit, sur l’incidence de face la vis était située au 1/3 inferieur du col et sur l’incidence de profil située au centre du col; sur le fémur gauche, en incidence de face la vis était située au 1/3 inférieur du col et sur l’incidence de profil, la vis était orientée de façon postéro-antérieure. Les radiographies de contrôle obtenues en post opératoire immédiat, après la chirurgie ont confirmé les positions du matériel d’ostéosynthèse . En post opératoire précoce, l’appui a été autorisé à gauche, mais pas à droite. Les suites opératoires étaient simples à 1 mois.
À 8 mois, le patient est revenu au rendez-vous, avec une boiterie, et une douleur de la hanche gauche. A la radiographie du bassin, il a été noté une ostéonécrose de la tête fémorale gauche . Le patient a bénéficié d’une ablation du matériel d’ostéosynthèse 3 mois plus tard, donc à 11 mois post opératoire. A 2 ans post opératoire, le patient présentait uniquement une boiterie mais avec absence de douleur à la hanche gauche; il a été également noté un raccourcissement du membre inférieur gauche de 1, 5cm avec une limitation de la rotation externe et de la rotation interne de la hanche gauche respectivement à 20° et à 10°. Le patient a été régulièrement suivi les sept années suivantes, il a été dispensé de toute activité sportive, la limitation des mouvements de la hanche gauche s’altérait lentement et progressivement, mais sans douleur. Neuf ans plus tard, après la première chirurgie, il a présenté en plus de son impotence fonctionnelle, une douleur de la hanche gauche, et a évolué vers une coxarthrose . L’indication de prothèse totale de hanche a été posée. Une prothèse totale de hanche de type non cimentée avec un couple de frottement céramique-céramique, à double mobilité, a été posée . Deux ans après, le patient ne présente aucune de douleur, il marche de façon autonome, et présente de très bonnes amplitudes articulaires de la hanche gauche. Le score fonctionnel de PMA est à 18.","

CR_FRE_215,French,"Il s'agit d'un patient âgé de 42 ans, tabagique chronique, ayant un comportement sexuel à risque, qui consultait pour une toux sèche d’évolution progressive depuis 5 mois et d'une hémoptysie de faible abondance associée à une dyspnée d'effort d'aggravation progressive et à une altération de l’état général. A l'admission, le patient était polypnéique, en mauvais état général (PS à 2). L'examen pleuro-pulmonaire trouvait des râles crépitants en basal gauche et une matité basale droite. L'examen ORL trouvait une tuméfaction rouge violacée du palais osseux, non douloureuse, évoluant depuis 2 mois. L'examen cutanéomuqueux trouvait des papules et nodules disséminés au niveau du visage, du dos, de la face antérieure du thorax, des deux membres inférieurs et au niveau de la verge, de 0, 3 à 3cm, rouges violacés, dures, non douloureux, ne s'effaçant pas à la vitro pression, remontant à 8 mois et augmentant progressivement de taille. Ces lésions faisant évoquer une localisation cutanée de la maladie de kaposi . La radiographie thoracique objectivait des opacités réticulo-nodulaires confluantes par endroit et diffuses aux deux champs pulmonaires avec prédominance aux bases . Le scanner thoracique montrait un foyer de condensation alvéolaire du lobe supérieur droit, des opacités micronodulaires bilatérales et un épaississement des septa péri-bronchovasculaires, un aspect en verre dépoli bilatéral et un épanchement pleural droit . L'hémogramme montrait une anémie hypochrome microcytaire à 9, 7g/dl, une lymphopénie à 510/µl. Le test rapide VIH était positif, confirmé par la sérologie VIH avec un taux de CD4 à 27/mm3. Les sérologies à cytomégalovirus, toxoplasmose, aspergillaire, hépatite B, hépatite C et syphilitique étaient négatives. Le bilan de la tuberculose était négatif. Le taux de LDH était normal à 226UI/l. La bronchoscopie objectivait une formation tumorale rougeâtre bourgeonnante dès l'entrée de la fosse nasale droite, une lésion rougeâtre à surface plane sur le versant antérieur de la carène et des plages discontinues de lésions rougeâtres à surface plane, étendues sur tout l'arbre bronchique dès l'entrée des 2 bronches principales. Ces lésions évoquaient une localisation bronchique de la maladie de kaposi. La biopsie cutanée avait confirmé la localisation cutanée de la maladie de Kaposi tandis que les biopsies bronchiques étaient non contributives. La recherche de bacilles de Kokh (BK) à l'examen direct et par culture ainsi que la recherche du PneumocystisJiroveci et la culture sur milieu de sabouraud dans le liquide d'aspiration bronchique étaient négatives. Le traitement était basé sur les antirétroviraux (Stavudine (D4T), Lamuvidine (3TC), Efavirenz (EFV)) et une chimiothérapie (Doxorubicine 50 mg/j en cure tous les 19 jours puis Tamoxifène). Une prophylaxie du PneumocystisJiroveci et Toxoplasmose était instaurée à base de TrimitoprimeSulfamétaxazol. L’évolution, après deux mois de traitement, était marquée par une amélioration clinique initiale puis aggravation progressive et décès dans un tableau d'insuffisance respiratoire aiguë.","

CR_FRE_218,French,"Un jeune homme âgé de 19 ans, sans antécédents particuliers est adressé pour des tuméfactions gingivales évoluant depuis 1 mois suite à des extractions dentaires. A l'interrogatoire, le patient rapportait un état général altéré (amaigrissement, fièvre, sueurs nocturnes, prurit généralisé) ainsi que des douleurs du membre inférieur droit. Il a rapporté avoir déjà été hospitalisé pour un bilan général qui s'est avéré normal excepté une vitesse de sédimentation élevée. Par ailleurs, il n'a pas été noté de déficit moteur ni sensitif. L'examen exobuccal a révélé une asymétrie faciale gauche avec la présence d'adénopathies cervicales à la palpation des aires ganglionnaires . L'examen clinique endobuccal a mis en évidence la présence de tuméfactions bourgeonnantes, ulcérées par endroit plus importantes au maxillaire qu'à la mandibule recouvrant les dents avec des déplacements et mobilités. Ces tuméfactions portaient l'empreinte des dents antagonistes. A la palpation, il s'agissait de tuméfactions molles et douloureuses . La radiographie panoramique montrait des lésions ostéolytiques généralisées avec un élargissement desmodontal et la disparition de la lamina dura ainsi qu'une opacité comblant la moitié inférieure du sinus maxillaire gauche . La tomodensitométrie de la face a révélé un processus tumoral comblant les sinus maxillaires . A ce stade, le diagnostic évoqué était celui d'une tumeur maligne des maxillaires ou une leucémie aiguë. Une biopsie a été réalisée sous anesthésie locale dont l'examen anatomopathologique concluait à une pseudotumeur inflammatoire ulcérée comportant quelques amas atypiques nécessitant un immuno-marquage pour exclure une lésion néoplasique. L'étude immunohistochimique a été en faveur d'une localisation gingivale d'un lymphome malin non hodgkinien à grandes cellules de type Burkitt, les cellules tumorales ayant exprimé le CD20 .
Le patient a été adressé au service d'oncologie pour une prise en charge. Le bilan biologique a montré un taux de LDH à 931UI/l, la sérologie pour le virus de l'immunodéficience humaine (VIH) était négative. Le myologramme était normal et la cytoponction a confirmé le diagnostic du lymphome de Burkitt. Le bilan d'extension comprenant une tomodensitométrie cervico-thoraco-abdomino- pelvienne a mis en évidence une lésion intracrânienne ainsi des localisations hépatiques. Selon la classification d'Ann-Arbor, le patient a été classé au stade IV groupe C vu l'atteinte endocrânienne.
Le traitement a inclue 5 séances de polychimiothérapie selon le protocole LMB qui se déroule en différentes phases : une cure de COP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prédnisone) suivie de deux cures de COPADEM (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicine, prédnisone) et de 2 cures de CYVE (c cytarabine, étoposide), ainsi que 9 séances de radiothérapie avec une régression totale des lésions buccales à un mois de chimiothérapie .

Au bilan on notait un syndrome inflammatoire important (VS: 90mm, CRP: 76 mg/l, Fg: 6g/l, EPP: profil inflammatoire avec hypoalbuminémie, à l’hémogramme on notait une hyperleucocytose à 13800 élts/mm3 à prédominance PNN: 10900 élts/mm3, anémie avec Hb: 11, 2g/dl normocytaire PLQ: N, Ferritinémie > 1500ng/ml, LDH: 200 UI/l, le bilan rénal et hépatique étaient normaux et les bilans infectieux et immunologique exhaustifs sont revenus négatifs. Une rechute de lymphome a été suspectée d’où réalisation d’une TDM étagée et d’un PET-scanner au FDG qui ont mis en évidence les adénomégalies cervicales bilatérales sans autres lésions.
Le curage ganglionnaire cervical et la BOM ont permis d′éliminer le diagnostic de rechute lymphomateuse. Devant l′association polyarthrite, rash maculopapuleux évanescent, fièvre vespérale, polyadénopathie et hyperferritinémie le diagnostic de maladie de Still a été évoqué d’autant plus que la fraction glyquée de la ferritine était effondrée < 20%.
Un traitement par corticoïdes a été initié d’abord en bolus puis relais per os à 1mg/kg/j avec une réponse partielle puis adjonction du Méthotrexate à 15 mg/semaine ayant permis une bonne évolution clinique (disparition des arthrites, des poussées cutanées et de la fièvre) et biologique (normalisation des paramètres de l’inflammation, du taux de leucocytes, de la ferritinémie et de sa fraction glyquée) en 6 semaines. Après 30 mois de suivi, la patiente est toujours asymptomatique son examen clinique et son bilan biologique sont strictement normaux.","

CR_FRE_227,French,"Il s'agit d'un nouveau né de 1 mois issu de parents consanguin de 1er degré consultant pour des vomissements. A l'interrogatoire, on a retrouvé la notion de décès de deux frères à l’âge de un mois dans un tableau de déshydratation aigue. L'examen clinique trouve des signes de déshydratation à type de yeux creux, des fontanelles antérieures déprimées, une bouche sèche et une hypotonie axiale. L'examen des organes génitaux externes révèle un bourgeon génital mesurant 1.5 cm/ 1 cm avec un hypospadias postérieur et des gonades en place . Un ionogramme sanguin réalisé en urgence retrouve une hyponatrémie à 120 mmol/l, une hyperkaliémie à 7 mmol/l, une glycémie à 0.74g/l, une hypochlorémie à 75 mmol/l et un taux de bicarbonates à 14 mmol/l. L’échographie abdominale a révélée une hyperplasie bilatérale des surrénales et organes génitaux externe de type masculins sans présence de dérivés müllériens. Le nourrisson a donc bénéficié en urgence, après réalisation de prélèvements sanguins pour des dosages hormonaux, d'une réhydratation par du sérum salé et d'un traitement par hémisuccinate d'hydrocortisone (6mg/kg/6h). L’évolution était favorable marquée par une disparition des signes de déshydratation et d'une correction des troubles ioniques. Le caryotype sanguin a montré une formule chromosomique 46 XY. Le bilan hormonal a retrouvé ultérieurement un taux de cortisolémie de 8h normal à 19, 9 µg/dl (VN: 4.2- 38.4), un taux d'ACTH élevé à 140 000 ng/ml (VN: 10.00- 70.00), un taux de 17 hydroxyprogéstérone supérieur à 20 ng/ ml, un taux de SDHEA élevé à 347 µg/dl, une testostéronémie à 1.09 ng/ ml et un taux de Delta 4 androsténédione à 124, 1 nmol/l et un taux d'activité rénine élevé à 3, 64 pmol/l (0.2- 2.8). Une génitographie réalisée a objectivé un urètre court de type masculin sans visualisation de vestiges müllériens. Ce tableau clinico- biologique confirme le diagnostic d'un bloc enzymatique en 3β hydroxystéroïde déshydrogénase. On a associé donc à son traitement, en plus de l'hydrocortisone à la dose de 20 mg/m2/j, de la fludrocortisone (50 µg/j). Une cure chirurgicale de son hypospadias a été réalisée après le traitement du micropénis par du Testoviron (25 mg tous les 15 jours).","

CR_FRE_228,French,"Il s’agit de Mme J.S âgée de 40 ans, sans antécédents, ayant présenté à l’âge de 24 ans une grossesse compliquée d’une toxémie gravidique avec un hématome rétro placentaire et une mort fœtale in utéro occasionnant une insuffisance rénale aigue. L’histologie rénale a conclu à une nécrose corticale. L’évolution était marquée par la dégradation progressive de sa fonction rénale. Le stade terminal de l’insuffisance rénale était atteint au bout de 6 ans. Elle était initialement hémodialysée via une fistule artério-veineuse (FAV) huméro-basilique droite pendant 6 mois vu la qualité des vaissaux grêle à la phlébographie, puis par l’intermédiaire d’une fistule huméro-céphalique gauche pendant une année. Plusieurs fistules ont par la suite été réalisées, suite à la thrombose itérative de ces accès vasculaires. Entre-temps, il n’a pas eu de tentatives de thrombectomies. Le bilan de thrombophilie, comportant le dosage du taux de Protéine C et S, antithrombine III, homocystéine, ainsi que la recherche des anticorps anti Beta 2 glycoprotein 1 et des anticorps anti-phospholipides, réalisé initialement était négatif. Le switch en dialyse péritonéale a été préconisé au bout de cinq ans marqué par la survenue ultérieurement de plusieurs épisodes de péritonites. La cartographie artérielle et veineuse a révélé une thrombose du tronc inominé droit avec une importante circulation veineuse collatérale cervicale, une infiltration athéromateuse marquée des artères humérales, radiales et cubitales, une thrombose veineuse étendue et bilatérale des veines fémorales communes et superficielle ainsi qu’une thrombose des deux artères fémorales superficielles dans leur tiers moyen. La confection d’une FAV au niveau des membres inférieurs était jugée impossible. Une transplantation rénale n’était pas envisageable également vu la multitude des thromboses et la qualité du réseau veineux abdomino-pelvien.
La dialyse a été par la suite assurée par la ponction des deux veines jugulaires externes pendant six mois. Elle était mise également sous traitement anti-aggrégant, qui a été arrêté vu le saignement important et le temps de compression allongé au retrait des aiguilles. Elle a bénéficié ultérieurement de la mise en place d’un pontage prothétique (Gortex) axillo-axillaire gauche qui s’est thrombosé au bout de deux ans. La dialyse péritonéale a été de nouveau indiquée, mais le cathéter (KT) était déplacé. Le repositionnement du KT s’est compliqué par la survenue d’une septicémie dont le germe n’a pu être identifié. L’évolution était favorable après ablation du KT et traitement antibiotique.
Une nouvelle cartographie a été réalisée, montrant une thrombose complète de la veine sous-clavière droite et partielle de la veine sous clavière gauche, ainsi qu’une thrombose des deux veines fémorales, des veines iliaques primitives, et de la veine cave supérieure . La mise en place d’une prothèse type PTFE ilio-rénale a été indiquée mais récusée en per-opératoire devant la présence d’une importante hépatomégalie avec saignement en nappe et des varicosités en rapport avec une hypertension portale. On a continué à dialyser la patiente par double ponction des veines jugulaires externes. Elle a bénéficié par la suite de la mise en place d’un cathéter tunnelisé au niveau de l’oreillette droite, par thoracotomie antéro-latérale droite à travers la veine cave inférieure. Les suites opératoires étaient simples. Au bout de trois mois, le KT n’était plus fonctionnel en raison d’une thrombose à son niveau. Un deuxième bilan de thrombophilie a été réalisé révélant un déficit en protéine C (42%). Ainsi, la patiente était mise sous traitement anticoagulant. L’angio-scanner thoraco-abdominal a mis en évidence une veine cave inférieure grêle avec la présence d’une sténose régulière à son niveau. Aucune alternative thérapeutique n’a pu être proposée par les chirurgiens cardio-vasculaires, et la patiente n’acceptait plus aucune intervention vasculaire. La dialyse est assurée depuis par la ponction des deux veines jugulaires externes. Après un recul de 18 mois, elle se porte relativement bien.","

Il a été hospitalisé immédiatement aux unités de soins intensifs pour la mise en route d’une antibiothérapie par ceftriaxon (100 mg/kg/j) et gentamycine (3mg/kg/j). Cette antibiothérapie avait été poursuivie pendant 48 heures et l’évolution clinique n’était pas satisfaisante d’où le changement de l’antibiothérapie par le ceftazidime et le flucloxacilline avec une bonne évolution. Les examens complémentaires initiaux avaient montré un syndrome inflammatoire modéré avec une leucocytose à 13200 éléments/mm3, une protéine C-réactive plasmatique (CRP) à 25 mg/dl initialement puis 51 mg/dl après 48h de traitement passer à 6, 7 mg/dl au bout de 48h du changement d’antibiothérapie.

CR_FRE_232,French,"Nous rapportons un cas de léiomyosarcome pleural primitif, survenu chez un homme de 64 ans. Le début de sa symptomatologie remonte au mois de Juillet 2010, par l'apparition d'une masse intra thoracique, augmentant progressivement de volume, évoluant dans un contexte de fièvre non chiffrée et d'altération de l′état général. Le patient a été adressé à l'Institut National d'Oncologie (INO), à Rabat, pour prise en charge. L'exploration radiologique a montré sur la tomodensitométrie abdominale un énorme processus lésionnel à paroi épaissie et à centre pseudo-nécrotique, de siège endothoracique, occupant la base thoracique droite, mesurant 14 x 9 cm de grand axe, refoulant la cavité cardiaque avec un discret épanchement péricardique. Cette tumeur a un développement en bas, exerçant un effet de masse sur le segment VIII et IV du foie primitifs . Un complément par angioscanner thoracique a confirmé l'aspect sus décrit. Une thoracotomie à visée diagnostique et thérapeutique a été réalisée. L'exploration chirurgicale a révélé une tumeur pleurale, très localement avancé envahissant le médiastin. Une simple biopsie a été effectuée. L’étude histologique a montré l'existence d'une formation tumorale maligne de nature sarcomateuse, caractérisée par une prolifération de cellules fusiformes disposées en faisceaux irrégulièrement enchevêtrés avec quelques foyers de nécrose ischémique, les cellules montrent une anisonucléose franche avec des noyaux hypertrophiques irréguliers, hyperchromatiques et inconstamment nucléolés, l'activité mitotique est importante (plus de 5 mitoses/10 champs au fort grandissement), un immunomarquage par l'anticorps anti-PS100 est resté négatif, l'anticorps anti-actine muscle lisse montre une positivité focale franche. Le diagnostic de léiomyosarcome de haut grade a été retenu. Notre patient a reçu une chimiothérapie à base de Doxorubicine à la dose de 60 mg / m2, administrée tous les 21 jours. L′évaluation après 6 cycles de chimiothérapie a retrouvé un bénéfice clinique et une réponse partielle radiologique estimée à 30%. Actuellement, il est en bon contrôle.","

L'examen clinique a retrouvé un patient apyrétique en bon état hémodynamique avec assourdissement des bruits du c'ur à l'auscultation cardiaque et une ischémie sous épicardique apico latérale sur l'ECG. La radiographie thoracique a montré un aspect légèrement globuleux de l'arc inférieur gauche. Le bilan biologique standard était sans particularité en dehors d'une hyperéosinophilie à 15%.
Le patient fut admis en cardiologie pour angor d'effort. L’échocardiographie trans thoracique a objectivé la présence d'un processus tumoral kystique multivésiculaire siégeant au niveau de la paroi latérale du ventricule gauche occupant toute l’épaisseur du segment moyen et apical avec trouble de la contractilité a ce niveau et un épanchement péricardique de moyenne abondance. Le scanner a mis en évidence une formation hypodense, liquidienne, homogène, grossièrement ovalaire mesurant 50×30mm environ, à paroi discrètement épaisse, non modifiée par le produit de contraste et calcifiée par endroit avec épanchement péricardique . Les coupes sous diaphragmatiques ont révélées la présence d'une énorme formation kystique rénale droite arrondie de 13.5 cm de diamètre, à paroi épaisse ne prenant pas le contraste et siège de fines cloisons . Ce processus refoule le pédicule rénal en arrière mais sans retentissement sur les voies excrétrices urinaires. Dans ses antécédents, le patient rapporte que son fils a été opéré il y a 6 mois pour une hydatidose hépato rénale.
Devant ce contexte clinique et radiologique le diagnostic de kystes hydatiques cardiaque et rénal grade III selon la classification de Gharbi (multivésiculaire) a été posé et ensuite confirmé par la chirurgie.

Le scanner abdominopelvien montrait la présence d'un syndrome occlusif mécanique de l'ensemble du grêle sur une probable invagination iléo-iléale, avec une image du boudin d'invagination, sans montrer de cause. L'indication opératoire était formelle. L'intervention chirurgicale, menée par une laparotomie médiane a chevale sur l'ombilic, a permis de confirmer la présence d'une IIA située à environ 70–80 cm de l'angle duodéno-jéjunale, avec une nécrose en partie du boudin d'invagination .

CR_FRE_247,French,"Informations relatives aux patients: patient de 60 ans, aux antécédents de tabagisme actif en raison de 16 paquets, de diabète type 2 ancien (environ 06 ans) sous insulinothérapie qui a été adressé au service d´Hémodynamique de l´Institut de Cardiologie d´Abidjan (ICA) pour une coronarographie diagnostique d´une douleur thoracique d´allure angineuse. On notait dans l´histoire des épisodes de douleurs thoraciques à l´effort avec une épreuve d´effort positive ayant fait évoquer un angor stable. On notait également des claudications intermittentes aux membres inferieurs depuis environ deux ans. Il n´y avait pas de notions de dyspnée, de palpitions ni de malaises.
Résultats cliniques: l'examen physique à l´entrée a révélé un sujet en bon état général, apyrétique avec une fréquence cardiaque à 65/minute, une fréquence respiratoire à 19/minute et une pression artérielle de 120/60 mmHg. Il n´y avait pas de notions de douleur thoracique active, de dyspnée, ni de signes périphériques d´insuffisance cardiaque. Les pouls pédieux étaient diminués d´intensité à la palpation. L´auscultation cardiaque et des axes artériels était sans particularité. L´examen des autres appareils notamment neurologique, pleuropulmonaire et digestif était sans particularité.
Chronologie: devant l´examen clinique satisfaisant, le patient a été proposé à la coronarographie. Un bilan pré-thérapeutique a été demandé à cet effet.
Démarche diagnostique: l'électrocardiogramme initial réalisé a montré un sus-décalage persistant du segment ST de 0, 1 mV, une onde Q de nécrose de grande amplitude (6mm) et de durée égale à 0, 02 seconde en aVR uniquement et des images en miroir en territoire inférieur . L´échocardiographie a permis d´objectiver une dysfonction systolique modérée (fraction d'éjection à 50%) et une akinésie de la paroi septo-apicale du ventricule gauche. Les résultats de laboratoire pertinents ont montré un taux de Troponine I normal (Troponine I=0, 025ng/ml). Le reste du bilan à savoir la fonction rénale (l´urée, la créatininémie) et le bilan d´hémostase (taux de Prothombine, le temps de céphaline kaolin) était normal.
Intervention thérapeutique: la coronarographie a été réalisée le lendemain. Après une anesthésie du point de ponction (Xylocaïne 2%), l´artère radiale a été ponctionnée selon la technique de Seldinger. Un désilet qui a la particularité d´avoir une valve étanche au reflux sanguin a été mis en place à travers lequel sont passées les sondes de coronarographie. La montée des sondes coronaires s´est faite sous scopie avec prudence, sans résistance. Les résultats montraient une atteinte pluri tronculaire coronaire attestée par une lésion serrée à 70-80% de l´artère interventriculaire antérieure moyenne, une occlusion homocontrolatéralisée des artères interventriculaire apicale et circonflexe moyenne et une occlusion controlatéralisée de la coronaire droite proximale . Devant l´atteinte pluri tronculaire des lésions il a été indiqué un pontage aorto-coronarien. Le patient a été proposé à la chirurgie vasculaire.
Suivi et résultats des interventions thérapeutiques: en fin de procédure, le patient avait bénéficié d´un traitement classique à base de Statine (Atorvastatine), de double antiagrégants plaquettaires (Acide acétylsalicylique, Clopidogrel) de Beta bloquants (Bisoprolol), d´Inhibiteur de l´Enzyme de Conversion (Ramipril) et de sensibilisation à l´arrêt du tabac. En attente de sa prise en charge spécialisée, un suivi régulier tous les six mois a été proposé.
Perspectives du patient: avant son admission en salle de cathétérisme, le patient a bénéficié d´une explication sur la procédure avec un document à l´appui pour pouvoir obtenir son avis. Il lui a été signifié les anomalies objectivées et la suite de la prise en charge chirurgicale.
Consentement éclairé: un consentement éclairé écrit, daté et signé a été obtenu du patient ayant permis la réalisation de ladite exploration.","

CR_FRE_248,French,"La technique utilisée a été la greffe composite de cuir chevelu sur mesure à partir d'un calque du sourcil controlatéral.
Dessin: les dessins du nouveau sourcil (zone receveuse) et de la zone donneuse sont réalisés à partir des repères de Westmore et d'un patron calqué sur le sourcil controlatéral. Tout d'abord, nous réalisons une empreinte du sourcil sain, en le repassant au crayon gras noir (crayon de maquillage) puis en appliquant dessus un calque (ou autre support transparent, dans le but de pouvoir visualiser cette empreinte même après avoir inversé ce calque) . Si les poils sont trop longs, il est utile de les couper un peu afin d'obtenir uniquement l'empreinte des racines permettant ainsi de déterminer leur direction. Cette empreinte du sourcil est découpée et constitue la référence à partir de laquelle sera choisie la zone donneuse . A partir du négatif obtenu après découpage de l'empreinte, on pourra dessiner la forme du sourcil à reconstruire à la manière d'un pochoir . Quant à son emplacement, il sera déterminé à partir du report des repères du sourcil sain s'il existe en s'aidant des repères de Westmore . Les repères d'un sourcil « idéal » selon les critères de Westmore sont comme suit : l'extrémité médiale se trouve sur la ligne verticale entre le point le plus latéral du cartilage alaire et le canthus interne; l'extrémité latérale se trouve sur la ligne oblique entre le point le plus latéral du cartilage alaire et le canthus externe; les 2 extrémités sont presque sur la même ligne horizontale; l'apex se trouve sur la ligne verticale passant par le limbe latéral.
Choix de la zone donneuse: c'est une étape clé dans la technique. De ce choix dépendra en partie le résultat cosmétique final. La bande de cuir chevelu peut être prélevée en retroauriculaire, en temporal ou en occipital. Au préalable, les cheveux seront coupés à ras au niveau de la région choisie. Le choix se fera en se référant à l'empreinte inversée du sourcil sain, afin d'obtenir une bande où les cheveux auront une densité et une orientation proches de celles de l'empreinte. La forme exacte du sourcil ou de la partie du sourcil à prélever sera dessinée au feutre sur la zone donneuse à travers le « pochoir » (négatif de l'empreinte) . Ce dessin sera complété en fuseau à ses extrémités afin d'obtenir une perte de substance suturable.
Prélèvement: le prélèvement sera réalisé sous anesthésie locale (xylocaïne simple au niveau de la zone donneuse et receveuse afin d’éviter tout spasme). Les incisions seront bien perpendiculaires au plan cutané pour ne pas couper les follicules pileux obliquement, ce qui les détruirait. Le prélèvement se fera de manière atraumatique. Le greffon composite sera soigneusement dégraissé en préservant les follicules pileux puis mis dans du sérum hépariné avec une expression douce. La zone donneuse sera suturée après hémostase.
Mise en place du greffon: tout d'abord on commence par préparer un lit bien vascularisé pour le greffon. Au niveau de la zone receveuse on excise le placard cicatriciel au niveau de la zone dessinée correspondant à l'emplacement du nouveau sourcil et on réalise une hémostase à minima. Le greffon est ensuite mis en place le greffon et suturé aux berges sans tension par des points simples au prolène 5/0.
Suites opératoires un pansement gras sera mis en place et ouvert au 5ème jour. L'ablation de fils se fera entre le 5ème et 7ème jour, et le greffon sera régulièrement recouvert par de la vaseline. Le greffon va passer par les différentes phases habituelles de toute greffe composite; blanc, bleu puis rose. Nous n'avons noté dans notre expérience aucune nécrose. Apres une perte partielle transitoire des poils du greffon dans les semaines qui suivent la cicatrisation, on note une repousse ultérieure et une densité définitive à 3mois satisfaisante.","

Elle fut explorée pour des coliques hépatiques avec élévations des transaminases et un épisode d'ictère spontanément résolutif dans les antécédents (il y a trois ans). La biologie montrait une cytolyse hépatique avec ASAT à 8N et ALAT à 10N sans cholestase ni stigmates d'insuffisance hépato cellulaire. Elle ne rapportait pas de prises médicamenteuses ni d'alcoolisme.
Les sérologies des hépatites virales B et C étaient négatives. L'échographie hépatique montrait un foie dysmorphique d'hépatopathie chronique sans signes d'hypertension portale ni lésions focales suspectes. Les anticorps anti nucléaires étaient négatifs ainsi que les anti mitochondries type M2 et les anti LKM1. Les anticorps anti muscles lisses étaient positifs et à des taux significatifs. Le reste du bilan biologique était sans anomalies en dehors d'une hypergammaglobulinémie polyclonale à 19 g/l faite principalement d'IgG. Ainsi le diagnostic d'une hépatite auto immune de type 1 fut retenu (ALAT > 5N, IgG élevées et anti muscles lisses positifs).

CR_FRE_251,French,"B.M, âgé de 23 ans, sans notion de contage tuberculeux, présentait depuis deux mois des douleurs abdominales diffuses avec trouble du transit à type de diarrhée glaireuse sans rectorragie évoluant dans un contexte d’asthénie, d’anorexie et d’amaigrissement chiffré à 10 kg. L’examen clinique à l’admission trouvait un patient apyrétique en mauvais état général, avec un abdomen distendu et une sensibilité de la fosse iliaque gauche sans organomégalie et le toucher rectal était normal. Les aires ganglionnaires périphériques étaient libres. La radiographie du thorax avait montré une pacchypleurite axillaire droite avec scissurite. La radiographie de l’abdomen sans préparation trouvait une aérocolie sans niveau hydro-aérique. Un lavement à la gastrografine a mis en évidence une lésion végétante étendue sur 4 cm et siégeant au niveau du côlon sigmoïde se raccordant en trognon de pomme avec le reste du côlon . La colonoscopie avait confirmé la présence d’une lésion ulcéro-bourgeonnante au niveau du côlon sigmoïde réduisant la lumière colique et évoquant une tumeur colique dont la biopsie était en faveur d’une colite granulomateuse sans nécrose caséeuse ni signes de malignité. L’échographie abdominale avait montré un épanchement liquidien en interanses, et la TDM abdomino-pelvienne avait objectivé en plus une stase stercorale colique en rapport avec épaississement pariétal circonférentiel et irrégulier du sigmoïde. Les examens biologiques ont montré une anémie microcytaire à 9, 6 g/dl et un syndrome inflammatoire non spécifique. L’IDR à la tuberculine et la recherche des mycobactéries dans les crachats étaient négatives. La sérologie HIV était négative et les marqueurs tumoraux (antigène carcino-embryonnaire, antigène carbo-hydrate 19-9) avaient des taux normaux.
Une laparotomie exploratrice était décidée. L’exploration chirurgicale avait trouvé un épanchement péritonéal séreux, des nodules péritonéaux et une distension colique en rapport avec une sténose du sigmoïde. Les gestes réalisés étaient une biopsie des nodules péritonéaux, une sigmoïdectomie avec anastomose colorectale.

CR_FRE_252,French,"M. SL âgé de 35 ans, sans antécédent pathologique connu, agriculteur habite à 200Km de Bamako. Il a été admis en réanimation pour hémopéritoine. Dix jours avant son admission il avait été victime d'une morsure de vipère à l'auriculaire gauche lors de travaux champêtres. Par la suite s'est installé progressivement un syndrome hémorragique fait de gingivorragie, d'hématurie, un saignement local et un œdème extensif dépassant l'épaule et atteignant l'hémi thorax. L'évolution était favorable après une dose de sérum antivenimeux (SAV). Au cinquième jour il est admis au centre de santé du district pour une distension abdominale sans notion de traumatisme. Le bilan fait en urgence objectiva une hémoglobinémie à 8, 7g/dl et un épanchement intra-péritonéal de moyenne abondance à l'échographie abdominopelvienne. Devant ce tableau une dose de sérum antivenimeux était administrée. L'évolution était marquée par la persistance de la douleur et la distension abdominale d'aggravation progressive motivant son transfert en réanimation du CHU du Point G. A l'évaluation clinique le patient était anxieux, un syndrome anémique fait de pâleur conjonctivale, une tachypnée à 26c/mn, une tachycardie à 113bts/mn, une distension abdominale avec une sensibilité à la palpation. Il était stable sur le plan hémodynamique. Les urines étaient claires au sondage urinaire. Le prélèvement de sang sur tube sec était incoagulable. A la biologie on notait une anémie normocytaire normochrome à 3, 8g/dl; une leucocytose à 16700/mm3, les plaquettes à 326000/mm3. La créatininémie était à 174μmol/l et l'urée sanguine à 20, 90mmol/l.
La prise en charge a consisté à une sérothérapie, une transfusion de 3 culots globulaires et de 2 plasmas frais congelés et une antibiothérapie par amoxicilline, et la réhydratation. Devant la persistance de la distension abdominale, après trois doses de SAV et la coagulation des prélèvements sur tube sec, une échographie de contrôle fut réalisée et objectivait un épanchement de grande abondance qui se reconstituait après chaque drainage. Le taux de prothrombine et le temps de céphaline plus activateur, réalisé tardivement pour des raisons techniques, étaient respectivement de 61%, et 27, 9 sec. Une laparotomie exploratrice était réalisée à J9 sous anesthésie générale. Elle a retrouvé un hématome retro péritonéal bombant dans le méso-colon de part et d'autre qui s'écoulait dans la cavité péritonéale, et un infarcissement mésentérique diffus sans saignement actif. Le geste a consisté à une évacuation de 1500 ml de sang, un toilettage au sérum physiologique et la mise en place de deux drains dans le rétro péritoine. Les suites opératoires ont été simples. Le patient était transféré en secteur d'hospitalisation de chirurgie à J3 post opératoire puis sortie d'hôpital à J19 post opératoire.","

CR_FRE_253,French,"Il s'agissait d'une patiente âgée de 20 ans, victime il y'a 3 ans d'un traumatisme fermé de l'abdomen et originaire d'une zone d'endémie hydatique. Elle était hospitalisée pour des douleurs épigastriques avec ictère, sans autre signe associé évoluant depuis 2 mois. L'examen clinique avait trouvé une sensibilité épigastrique sans masse palpable. Le bilan biologique montrait une cholestase (bilirubine totale a ‘ 140 mmol/L, bilirubine conjugue à 80 mmol/L, phosphatases alcalines à 700 UI/L) et une cytolyse (aspartate aminotransférase 320 UI/L, alanine aminotransferase 288 UI/L), le taux de prothrombine était à 75%. La fonction rénale était normale ainsi que l'amylasémie (50UI/L). L’échographie abdominale retrouvait, au niveau du pancréas dans sa partie corporéo-caudale, une formation lobulée anéchogène avec présence d'une vésicule endokystique, évoquant en premier lieu un cystadénome. La TDM abdominale, confirmait l'existence de cette masse avec coque peu épaisse et une vésicule endokystique, avec un développement exophytique . Le CA 19-9 était normal, la lipasémie et la radio du thorax étaient normales. La sérologie hydatique n’était pas demandée.Le diagnostic d'une formation kystique du pancréas était retenu, mais sa nature hydatique n’était pas reconnue. La patiente était opérée par voie sous-costale gauche élargie à droite. L'exploration trouvait un kyste hydatique corporéo-caudale à contenu uni-vésiculaire . Après protection par des champs imbibés d'une solution scoliocide, il a été réalisé une ponction vidange et une stérilisation du kyste, suivie d'une résection du dôme saillant et un drainage . Les suites opératoires étaient simples avec une régression de l'ictère, une disparition de la douleur et une normalisation du bilan biologique. La patiente sortait au 10e jour postopératoire.

CR_FRE_254,French,"Patiente âgée de 47 ans, sans antécédent pathologique notable, hospitalisée pour myalgies avec faiblesse musculaire prédominant aux ceintures pelvienne et scapulaire. L'atteinte musculaire était précédée de plusieurs placards érythémato-nodulaires douloureux siégeant au niveau des 2 bras et des 2 cuisses apparus 2 mois auparavant associés à un érythème violacé des paupières et du décolleté et un livédo des membres inférieurs. Le testing musculaire avait conclu à un déficit musculaire proximal et l’électromyogramme à un tracé myogène diffus. Le dosage des enzymes musculaires montrait une créatine phosphokinase (CPK) élevée à 1953 UI/L soit 15 fois la normale et une lactate déshydrogénase à 6 fois le normale. Le bilan immunologique (anticorps anti nucléaires, anti J01, anti Sm, anti RNP, anti SSa et anti SSb) était négatif. La biopsie des lésions nodulaires avait mis en évidence: un épiderme en partie ulcérée, la couche basale intacte ne comportant pas de corps hyalin. Le derme sous jacent comporte une inflammation polymorphe et discrète de siège péri vasculaire. Ces derniers sont de morphologie normale, non ectasiques et non congestifs. L'hypoderme est caractérisé par une discrète inflammation de siège septale et panniculaire. Elle est composée par des petits lymphoplasmocytes réguliers associés à de rares polynucléaires . Par ailleurs absence de cellules lymphoïdes suspectes ou de signes histologiques de malignité avec une immunohistochimie (CD3, CD20, CD4, CD8) négative. Le diagnostic d'une panniculite associée à une DM était retenu. Le bilan clinico-biologique effectué à la recherche d'une néoplasie sous-jacente et comportant: l'examen physique, les marqueurs tumoraux, la fibroscopie digestive, la radiographie du thorax, l’échographie et le scanner thoraco-abdomino-pelvien était négatif. Le bilan lésionnel de la dermatomyosite n'a pas montré d'atteinte viscérale associée: les explorations fonctionnelles respiratoires étaient normales, le scanner thoracique ne montrait que des images d'atélectasies banales et l’échographie cardiaque était sans anomalies. Une corticothérapie à base de boli de méthyl prednisolone (1 g/jour pendant 3 jours) relayés par une corticothérapie orale à la dose de 1 mg/Kg/j et du méthotrexate à la dose de 30 mg/sem étaient prescrits.

La dapsone à la dose de 100mg/jour pendant 2 mois et les antipaludéens de synthèse( Hydroxychloroquine 400mg/jour) étaient également inefficaces. Devant la résistance de la panniculite aux différentes thérapeutiques à savoir: corticoïdes, Méthotrexate, Dapsone et Hydroxy chloroquine, un traitement par Immunoglobulines polyvalentes intraveineuses (IgIV) était introduit (6 cures à la dose de 2g/Kg/cure). L’évolution était spectaculaire dès la première cure avec stabilisation puis nette régression des lésions de panniculite . Trois mois après l'arrêt des Ig IV, il y a eu une reprise évolutive des lésions de panniculite nécessitant la réintroduction mensuelle d'Ig IV (6 cures) avec de nouveau une rémission dès la première cure.","

CR_FRE_257,French,"Information de la patiente: une patiente âgée de 34 ans, se présente en consultation ophtalmologique pour la prise en charge d´une exophtalmie de l´œil gauche. Elle présentait comme antécédent un accident de la voie publique remontant à deux ans avant, avec un double impact crânio-facial et au niveau des membres inférieurs. La tomodensitométrie cérébrale réalisée initialement n´avait pas objectivé de lésion post traumatique. Par ailleurs elle présentait une fracture de la cheville traitée chirurgicalement. Un an après, la patiente commençait à installer une exophtalmie gauche lentement progressive sans autre signe associé, pour laquelle elle n´avait consulté qu´après presque un an d´évolution.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen ophtalmologique trouvait : au niveau de l´œil droit: acuité visuelle à 110, pas d´anomalie au niveau des annexes, motilité oculaire conservée. Segment antérieur: cornée claire, bonne chambre antérieure, bon réflexe photomoteur directe et consensuel, cristallin clair et un bon tonus oculaire. Fond d´œil: papille normale avec un bon reflet maculaire. Au niveau de l´œil gauche: acuité visuelle à 110. Au niveau des annexes: léger ptosis, exophtalmie axile non réductible, non douloureuse et pulsatile, avec une motilité oculaire conservée sans paralysie. On notait également une dilatation sinueuse des vaisseaux épiscléraux surtout en nasal . Segment antérieur: cornée claire, bonne chambre antérieure, bon réflexe photomoteur directe et consensuel, cristallin clair et un tonus oculaire élevé à 34mmhg. Fond d´œil: excavation papillaire à 4/10 avec une tortuosité des axes veineux. Le reflet maculaire était sans anomalies.
Démarche diagnostique: la tomodensitométrie cérébrale demandée en urgence vu le contexte traumatique même ancien avait objectivé une exophtalmie stade I avec un élargissement de la loge caverneuse et son opacification au temps artériel après injection du produit de contraste, et une dilatation de la veine ophtalmique supérieure homolatérale, aspect en faveur d´une fistule carotido-caverneuse gauche . On avait complété par une artériographie qui avait objectivé un aspect en faveur d´une fistule carotido-caverneuse gauche Barrow A, avec un polygone de Willis fonctionnel, et une occlusion de la carotide interne gauche intra-caverneuse avec présence sur sa terminaison d´une image anévrysmale de 8mm intra-caverneuse rompue en plein chenal au sein du sinus caverneux .
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: la patiente était adressée en neuroradiologie pour prise en charge, mais perdue de vue depuis sans bénéficier d´embolisation.","

L’IRM cervicale a objectivé un magma d’adénopathies cervicales et sus-claviculaires avec infiltration de la graisse masseterienne. Une biopsie du processus oculaire bourgeonnant a été réalisée concluant à une inflammation granulomateuse tuberculoïde, avec nécrose caséeuse compatible avec une tuberculose évolutive. La TDM thoracique objective de multiples nodules pulmonaires avec adénopathies médiastinales . La recherche de BK dans les crachats est revenue négative, la bronchoscopie pulmonaire a retrouvé 3 masses bourgeonnantes bronchiques nécrosées dont l’examen anatomo-pathologique révèle un granulome tuberculoïde sans nécrose caséeuse.

Il fume environ 20 cigarettes par jour et n'a aucun antécédent cardiovasculaire personnel ou familial connu. L'examen clinique montre un patient avec un bon état général, eupnéique au repos et normocoloré.
Sa tension artérielle brachiale est de 160/110 mmHg à droite et 145/100 mmHg à gauche. Il a une fréquence cardiaque de 70 battements par minute, une température mesurée à 36, 8°C et une saturation en oxygène de 100% à l'air ambiant. L'auscultation cardio-pulmonaire est normale. L’électrocardiogramme montre un rythme sinusal avec quelques extrasystoles auriculaires, une fréquence à 55 par minutes et des ondes T négatives en inférieur et en antérolatéral compatibles avec une maladie cardiaque.
Le bilan sanguin montre un examen hématologique et un ionogramme normaux. La troponine T ultrasensible au temps zéro et après 3heures est normale. La radiographie du thorax de face montre un élargissement de l'aorte thoracique estimé à 90 mm avec déroulement de l'aorte justifiant la réalisation d'un angio scanner total de l'aorte montrant la présence d'un volumineux anévrisme du versant postérieur de la crosse de l'aorte et de la moitié supérieure de l'aorte thoracique descendante.

CR_FRE_265,French,"Patient âgé de 41 ans, hospitalisé pour l'exploration d'une double localisation tumorale hépatique et rénale, découverte à la suite de douleurs de l'hypochondre droit. L'examen clinique trouvait une masse sous costale droite sensible à la palpation. La tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdominale montrait que la masse palpée était au dépend des segments VI et VII du foie. Elle mesurait 95 mm de diamètre et était hypo dense, arrondie avec des limites nettes. Elle ne prenait pas le produit de contraste. Cet aspect évoquait un kyste hydatique du foie. Au niveau du rein gauche, l'examen trouvait une formation tissulaire de la lèvre postérieure, prenant le contraste et mesurant 30 mm de diamètre. L'imagerie par résonnance magnétique (IRM) montrait que le nodule rénal était en hypo signal T1 et en hyper signal T2, se rehaussant de manière hétérogène. La masse hépatique était multi-cloisonnée, en hyper signal T2 hétérogène. Les cloisons étaient épaisses et bourgeonnantes par endroits, prenant le contraste sur les séquences tardives .
Le diagnostic de kyste hydatique hépatique devenait peu probable en dehors d'une forme atypique. Les diagnostics évoqués étaient soit une métastase hépatique d'une tumeur rénale ou une association fortuite d'un cystadénome hépatique et d'une tumeur rénale. Biologiquement, la sérologie du kyste hydatique et de l’échinococcose alvéolaire était négative. Les marqueurs tumoraux (œfoeto-protéine, CA19-9 et antigène carcino-embryonnaire) étaient négatifs. Il a été décidé de réaliser une résection des lésions hépatiques avec une tumorectomie rénale. Sur la pièce de résection hépatique, la tumeur mesurait 12 x 4 cm, était d'aspect pseudo-kystique avec un nodule charnu blanc jaunâtre de 4 cm de grand axe. Le rein montrait un nodule ferme de 2, 5 x 2 cm, d'aspect hétérogène jaune-grisâtre avec des remaniements hémorragiques. L'examen histologique le la tumeur hépatique montrait une prolifération d'architecture pseudo-papillaire et tubulaire au sein d'un stroma richement vascularisé . Les cellules tumorales étaient cubiques, à noyaux réguliers avec une chromatine granulaire. L’étude immuno-histochimique (IHC) montrait la positivité de la cytokératine totale et de la vimentine. La chromogranine A était négative. L'examen histologique et IHC de la tumeur rénale était comparable à celui observé au niveau du foie. L′index mitotique était évalué à 3 mitoses /10 champs au fort grossissement (CFG). Il n'a pas été observé de foyers de nécrose tumorale. L'index de prolifération, évalué à l’étude IHC par le Ki 67 était d'environ 3% des cellules tumorales. Les limites chirurgicales hépatiques et rénales passaient en zone saine.
Le diagnostic retenu était celui d'un carcinome papillaire du rein de type I, de grade I de Fürhman métastasant au niveau du foie. Les suites opératoires étaient simples et le patient était perdu de vue. Douze ans après, il avait consulté pour l'apparition d'autres métastases hépatiques, osseuses et pulmonaires. La biopsie hépatique montrait une prolifération tumorale tubulaire d'aspect comparable à celui observé dans le foie et le rein. A l’étude IHC, les cellules tumorales étaient diffusément positives avec la cytokératine totale, la synaptophysine et le CD 56 . Elles étaient négatives avec la chromogranine A. Au vue de ces résultats, le diagnostic final était celui d'un carcinoïde primitif du rein associé à de multiples localisations secondaires hépatiques, osseuses et pulmonaires. Le patient a reçu une chimiothérapie à base de Cisplatine. Après 18 mois d’évolution, le malade est stable.","

Le fond d’œil mit en évidence un œdème papillaire stade I. Ainsi, le scanner cérébral réalisé montra une hyperdensité spontanée des sillons corticaux fronto-pariétaux droits accompagnés d’une hypodensité du parenchyme sous cortical d’allure oedèmateuse, avec en plus un défaut de réhaussement du sinus longitudinal supérieur étendu au sinus latéral droit et le signe du delta vide .

Au bilan biologique, nous avons noté une anémie à 7, 8g/dl hypochrome microcytaire, des globules blancs à 10230/mm3, des plaquettes à 260000/mm3, un INR incoagulable, une créatininémie à 10, 3g/l estimant le débit de filtration glomérulaire à 77ml/min/1, 73m2 (Formule MDRD simplifiée), une albuminémie à 34g/l, protidémie à 63g/l. L'examen de la bandelette urinaire s'est révélé négatif sans hématurie ni macroalbuminurie. Les taux sériques des p-ANCA, c-ANCA, Ac anti-MBG, AC anti-DNA ainsi que le facteur rhumatoïde se sont révélés négatifs. L'échocardiographie transthoracique a montré une fonction ventriculaire normale et aucune valvulopathie. Le cliché standard du thorax a révélé à la phase d´état des opacités alvéolaires bilatérales diffuses, ce qui nous a incité à compléter par une TDM thoracique retrouvant des lésions alvéolaires multiples bilatérales . Enfin, une endoscopie bronchique avec lavage broncho-alvéolaire (LBA) fut réalisé retrouvant un liquide uniformément hémorragique avec cultures revenues stériles.","

CR_FRE_271,French,"Mr E.M, âgé de 42 ans, il présentait depuis sa naissance, une asymétrie des fentes palpébrales. A l'âge de 17 ans, il a été opéré d'une tumeur méningée sphéno-orbitaire droite, qui s'est manifestée par des douleurs retro-orbitaire droite. Le diagnostic histologique était celui d'une mélanomatose méningée, pire que le diagnostic soit resté imprécis. L'évolution est restée stable pendant 25 ans. Les documents radiologiques qui ont été effectués durant cette période ont été détruits dans un incendie. En raison d'une exophtalmie avec ophtalmoplégie droite et baisse de l'acuité visuelle rapidement progressive sur 3 mois, une nouvelle IRM cérébrale, comprenant des séquences pondérées T1 et T2, puis T1 après injection de gadolinium dans les trois plans a été réalisée. Elle montrait une lésion extra-axiale développée au niveau du sinus caverneux droit, s'étendant vers l'orbite avec une extension vers la fosse infra-temporale et les muscles ptérygoïdiens. Cette lésion apparaissait bien limitée, sans signes d'envahissement cérébral et présentait un signal globalement hyperintense en T1 et hypointense en T2. La lésion prenait le contraste de manière homogène et intense . L'intervention chirurgicale a été réalisée par un abord ptérional, macroscopiquement, il s'agissait d'une tumeur noirâtre molle et gélatineuse très hémorragique, dont l'exérèse était subtotale. En microscopie, la tumeur était constituée de cellules fusiformes avec des noyaux ovalaires discrètement irréguliers et un cytoplasme abondant apparaissant rempli de pigments marqués par la coloration de Fontana (coloration de la mélanine). Les mitoses étaient présentes en nombre supérieur à trois pour dix champs à fort grossissement. Il n'y avait pas de nécrose. En immunohistochimie, les cellules étaient positives pour HMB45. L'index mitotique évalué avec l'anticorps anti-Ki 67 était de 20% . Une radiothérapie adjuvante était proposée mais l'évolution est marquée, un mois après l'intervention par l'apparition d'une méningite d'allure bactérienne traitée par antibiothérapie adaptée. Deux semaines après, le patient présentait une aggravation neurologique brutale. Le bilan neuroradiologique montrait une énorme récidive tumorale avec diffusion leptoméningée massive associée a une hémorragie intra parenchymateuse et intra ventriculaire et l'état neurologique restait précaire jusqu'au décès, deux mois plus tard soit moins d'un an après la réapparition des signes cliniques, et vingt-cinq ans après la première intervention.","

CR_FRE_272,French,"Il s´agit d´un patient âgé de huit (8) ans au moment du diagnostic, de sexe masculin, sans antécédent médical ni chirurgical particulier, admis pour le bilan échographique d´une douleur abdominale évoluant depuis plusieurs mois.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen clinique retrouvait au niveau du pelvis une masse palpable, mobile, sensible d´environ 40 mm de diamètre.
Démarche diagnostique: l´examen d´imagerie médicale demandé a d´abord été une échographie abdomino-pelvienne. Elle a été réalisée avec un appareil de marque Mindray DC70 mis en service pour la première fois le 2020. Une sonde abdominale multifréquence de 2>.5- 5 Mhz a été utilisée. L´examen a été réalisé chez un patient dévêtu, en décubitus dorsal. L´échographie avait montré une anomalie de position du foie et de la rate: le foie dans l´hypochondre gauche et la rate dans l´hypochondre droit . Une hépatomégalie homogène avec un grand axe estimé à 132 mm; une rate de petite taille dont le grand axe est mesuré à 32 mm. Il est également retrouvé une masse ovalaire d´écho structure tissulaire iso échogène à la rate, de siège pelvien supra vésical, latéralisée à droite avec un grand axe estimé à 45, 7 mm .
Un scanner abdomino-pelvien a été recommandé pour complément de bilan. Cet examen a été réalisé avec un scanner de marque Hitachi®Supria mis en service le 1er octobre 2017. Les constantes utilisées étaient de 120 KV et 80 mA et les coupes réalisées étaient de 3 mm jointives. L´examen a été réalisé chez un patient à jeun, en décubitus dorsal, tête en premier. Deux séries d´acquisition ont été effectuées dont l´une sans injection de produit de contraste et l´autre avec injection IV de produit de contraste. Les images acquises après injection IV du produit de contraste ont permis de redresser le diagnostic qui s´établit de la manière suivante: le foie occupait les deux hypochondres avec une taille quasi normale des deux lobes hépatiques ; le hile et la vésicule biliaire étaient sur la ligne médiane . Il n´y avait pas de rate dans les hypochondres et la masse pelvienne sus vésicale était homogène, iso dense au parenchyme splénique et se rehaussait de façon identique à la rate ; c´est la rate en question (il s´agit d´une rate flottante) . Son pédicule vasculaire artériel était directement relié à l´aorte abdominale à hauteur du tronc cœliaque . Une anomalie de rotation du tube digestif à type de mésentère commun complet (de type habituel) avec les anses grêles à droite et le colon à gauche dans l´abdomen a été également notée . Il a été constaté sur les coupes basi-thoraciques obtenues au moment de l´acquisition de la tomodensitométrie (TDM) que le cœur était en position normale à gauche .
Intervention thérapeutique: aucun acte d´intervention chirurgical n´est indiqué. Cependant c´est une situation clinique particulière qui impose d´informer le patient sur sa situation particulière. Il a également été sensibilisé sur le fait que d´une la rate en position pelvienne et mobile doit être protégée contre d´éventuel traumatisme et d´autre part à chaque consultation médicale il doit informer le médecin de sa situation particulière. Il a également bénéficié de l´administration d´antalgique (paracétamol) contre les douleurs.
Suivi et résultats: en respectant les mesures d´hygiène de vie indiquées et le traitement antalgique, les douleurs abdominales ont été amendées.

Cliniquement, la patiente était asymptomatique. Elle présentait des adénopathies sous digastrique et rétro spinale. L’examen clinique ainsi que les examens complémentaires n’avaient pas retrouvé le foyer primitif. L’évolution a été marquée par l’apparition 5 ans plus tard d’une obstruction nasale droite permanente, associée à une épistaxis et une rhinorrhée droite. La rhinoscopie a montré une formation bourgeonnante comblant la fosse nasale droite et arrivant jusqu’au vestibule narinaire droit. L’examen tomodensitométrique du massif facial a montré un comblement tissulaire de la fosse nasale droite et du sinus maxillaire droit sans lyse osseuse associée. Le cavum et l’oropharynx étaient libres. Une biopsie de la fosse nasale a été pratiquée. L’examen anatomopathologique a montré une prolifération tumorale maligne d’architecture vaguement nodulaire, au sein d’un stroma grêle fibro-inflammatoire . La prolifération était faite de cellules globuleuses au centre et fusiformes en périphérie. Ces cellules étaient de grande taille, atypiques, munies d’un nucléole proéminent et présentant une activité mitotique élevée. Aucun pigment mélanique n’a été retrouvé.

Ce qui a motivé son adresse par un médecin généraliste au service des urgences
A l'admission, l'examen clinique a montré un patient en mauvais état général, pâle, fébrile (38.5 C), avec une tachycardie à 95 battement/min, et une hypotension artérielle à 10/06mm Hg. L'examen de l'abdomen a montré une défense, avec sensibilité localisée à la région épigastrique, ainsi qu'une hépato-splénomégalie. L'examen cutanéo muqueux a montré la présence d'un purpura pétéchial, localisé au niveau des deux bras et des jambes, sans ecchymoses et sans papules (leucémides), notamment pas d'ictère. A L'examen ORL on a noté une otite moyenne aigue purulente droite. Alors que l'examen de la cavité buccale était normal: absence d'hypertrophie gingivale et amygdalienne.
L'examen des aires ganglionnaires a objectivé la présence d'adénopathies cervicales et inguinales bilatérales centimétriques fermes et indolores. Le reste de l'examen clinique était sans particularité notamment: un examen neurologique normal éliminant une éventuelle infiltration blastique neuro méningée, et un examen pleuro pulmonaire sans particularités. Un bilan biologique a été demandé et a montré: à la NFS une hyperleucocytose majeur à 123 G/L, avec une anémie normochrome normocytaire à 4g/dl, et une thrombopénie profonde à 14 G/L. Le frottis sanguin a permis de réaliser une numération qui a montré la présence d'une blastose à 60%, une monocytose à 5 G/L, et un excès de polynucléaires éosinophiles dysplasiques (noyau monolobé, trilobé, granulations immatures, vacuoles cytoplasmiques) .

CR_FRE_279,French,"O.K., âgé de 6 ans, élève en première année primaire dont la mère est venue consulté le Centre Neuropsychiatrique Dr Joseph-Guislain pour un trouble de comportement fait d'agressivité avec passage à l'acte, d'agitation, de dysharmonie dans son comportement alimentaire, nervosité et refus d'obtempérer aux ordres des parents, de déambulation avec refus catégorique de retourner à son domicile. Le début de l'histoire de la maladie remontait à deux mois de ces manifestations, quand l'enfant revenait de l’école avec ses amis et se dirigea par curiosité dans une cabine de transformation du courant électrique de haute tension en basse tension qui était implantée sur son passage; une fois dans cette cabine, l'enfant sera électrisé et projeté en dehors cette dernière. Ce sont les passagers qui le prendront dans un état d'inconscience qui avait duré quelques 5 à 10 minutes et l'acheminera dans une structure médicale où les premiers soins de réanimation ont été administrés. Ce n'est qu'après 24 heures que le patient va se rétablir, commença à marcher et à parler, ainsi il expliqua lui-même les faits et dira qu'il avait senti une sorte d'aimantation entre lui et le fil électrique qu'il avait touché, puis un relâchement brusque (surement que c’était une contraction musculaire qui « gèle » la victime sur la source de contact (c'est le « can not let go » des anglo-saxons). Deux mois plus tard, l'enfant manifestera un trouble de comportement et ceci va motiver la mère de l'enfant à consulter le Centre Neuropsychiatrique Dr Joseph-Guislain pour une prise en charge. Ses antécédents ne montrent rien de particulier.
L'anamnèse révélait que l'enfant refuse de se laver et de manger par moment sans raison aucune et présente un rire immotivé. L'examen neuropsychiatrique mettait en évidence une altération de fonctions intellectuelles et un état confusionnel (une altération de la mémoire d’évocation et de fixation, une désorientation temporo-spatiale), une marche ébrieuse, une agitation et instabilité (il faisait le 100 pas), un refus catégorique d'obéir aux ordres. Sur le plan somatique, nous avons objectivé des cicatrices de brûlures cutanées, à prédominance deuxième degré, ayant intéressé environ 15% de la surface corporelle, siégeant au niveau du 1/3 antéro-externe de l'avant-bras droit, au niveau du gril costal droit (entre la 2ème et la 7ème côte) et au niveau des orteils de deux côtés. Aucune lésion cutanée objectivée au niveau du crâne. Nous avions conclu à un trouble psychotique avec excitation psychomotrice associé à un syndrome cérébelleux post AE et nous avons instauré un traitement fait de Pipamperone (15 gouttes deux fois par jour), Chlorpromazine (25 mg deux fois par jour).
Le scanner cérébral réalisé n'avait pas mis en évidence de lésion osseuse et avait révélé une hémorragie sous-durale essentiellement dans la faux du cerveau (8 mm épaisseur), une nette hypodensité de la substance blanche avec ventricule latéral droit d'aspect comprimé comparé au gauche suggérant un oedème cérébral, sans déviation de la ligne médiane et des sillons pariétaux droits moins exprimés . L’électroencéphalogramme réalisé était perturbé par l'abondance en éléments lents diffus. L’électrocardiogramme était normal. Au vu de tous ces éléments, nous avions conclu à une hémorragie sous-durale et un oedème cérébral post AE.
Le patient avait été soumis sous un traitement fait de Dexaméthasone (4 mg deux fois par jour pendant 3 jours puis une fois 4 mg par jour pendant 2 jours) et Piracetam (800 mg deux fois par jour pendant 14 jours). Après une semaine de traitement, l'enfant ne présentait aucune plainte et l'examen neuropsychiatrique était normal. Le scanner cérébral réalisé après deux semaines de traitement avait montré une résorption de l'oedème et de l'hématome . L'enfant était sorti au J18 d'hospitalisation.","

Les deux patients consultaient pour des douleurs résiduelles en regard de la base du M5 avec une gêne fonctionnelle importante et diminution de la force de serrage limitant les gestes de la vie quotidienne. Le premier patient, âgé de 22 ans, droitier, a été vu au quatrième mois d'une luxation négligée de la base du M5 droit faisant suite à un coup de poing contre un plan dur . Le deuxième patient, âgé de 39 ans, droitier, était victime d'une fracture-luxation de la base du M5 ayant consolidé en cal vicieux articulaire avec un raccourcissement de M5 du fait d'une mauvaise réduction initiale. Une arthroplastie stabilisée du M5 a été pratiquée chez les deux patients.
Description de la technique opératoire: La chirurgie se déroule sous anesthésie locorégionale avec hémostase préventive par garrot pneumatique à la racine du membre. L'incision est longitudinale située à mi-distance entre le 4ème et le 5ème métacarpien. L'exposition de la base du M5 permet de visualiser les dégâts ostéo-cartilagineux. Une ostéotomie métaphysaire proximale du M5 permet de réséquer 5 à 10 mm de la région épiphyso-métaphysaire et d'éliminer le conflit articulaire carpo-métacarpien du 5ème rayon. Les surfaces corticales médiale du 4ème métacarpien (M4) et latérale du M5 sont avivées à la scie sur 2 cm au niveau de la région métaphyso-diaphysaire proximale. Le fragment osseux réséqué initialement de la base du M5 est préparé après avoir enlevé tous les débris cartilagineux. Il est ensuite chassé et intercalé au niveau de la région avivé entre M4 et M5. La stabilisation se fait par un embrochage transversal entre M4 et M5 de façon parallèle sous contrôle d'un amplificateur de brillance et en maintenant le 4ème et le 5ème doigt en syndactylie pour ne pas avoir des troubles rotatoires ou une abduction du 5ème rayon .
La fermeture se fait après hémostase et lavage abondant à fin d'éliminer tout débris ostéo-cartilagineux résiduel. Une manchette plâtrée est confectionnée en fin d'intervention maintenue pendant 6 semaines associée à une syndactylie entre le 4ème et le 5ème doigt. Une mobilisation digitale est débutée immédiatement après la chirurgie. L'ablation du plâtre se fait entre 6 à 8 semaines suivant le contrôle radiologique de l'arthrodèse. L'ablation des broches se fait à 2 mois suivie d'une rééducation régulière des chaînes digitales et du poignet avec renforcement de la force d'opposition et du serrage. Après vérification radiologique de la consolidation et une rééducation bien suivie, les deux patients ont repris leur travail à 3 mois post-opératoires. A quatre ans de recul, le résultat fonctionnel a été jugé très bon avec une mobilité normale du 5ème doigt notamment en abduction, adduction, une conservation de la longueur et de la force de serrage par rapport au côté controlatéral. La mobilité en flexion-extension du bloc M4-M5 est de 25° comparée à 40° de l'autre côté . L'opposition pouce-cinquième doigt est symétrique. Le bilan radiologique montre une arthrodèse bien consolidée dans les deux cas .","

CR_FRE_284,French,"Il s´agit d´une patiente de 19 ans, primigeste et primipare, sans antécédents pathologiques particuliers, qui a présenté 4 semaines après son accouchement par césarienne des épigastralgies d´installation brutale, intenses, transfixiantes et à irradiation dorsale, associées à des nausées et des vomissements évoluant dans un contexte de sensations fébriles.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen clinique a objectivé une patiente consciente, stable sur le plan hémodynamique et respiratoire (fréquence cardiaque= 94 battements par minute, fréquence respiratoire= 22 cycles par minute, tension artérielle=138/80 mmHg, saturation en oxygène = 95%), apyrétique (température =36, 7°C) et un score de SIRS (syndrome de réponse inflammatoire Systémique) à l´admission à 3. L´examen abdominal a montré une sensibilité épigastrique, sans autres anomalies décelables au reste de l´examen somatique.
Démarche diagnostique: le bilan biologique a révélé une lipasémie à 2200 UI/l (36 fois la normale), une hyperleucocytose à 22210/μl à prédominance neutrophiles (19290μ/l), une protéine C réactive (CRP) à 59 mg/l, une cytolyse hépatique (Aspartate aminotransférase (ASAT)= 321 U/l et Alanine aminotransférase (ALAT)= 464 U/l), ainsi qu´une cholestase biologique (Bilirubine totale= 132 μmol/l, Bilirubine conjuguée= 83, 5 μmol/l, Phosphatases alcalines (PAL)= 240 U/l, Gamma glutamyl transférase (GGT)= 792 U/l), le reste du bilan biologique était sans anomalies. La tomodensitométrie (TDM) abdominale réalisée 72 heures après le début de la symptomatologie a montré un aspect de pancréatite aigüe stade E de Balthazar associée à des coulées de nécrose pancréatique. L´enquête étiologique a écarté la notion d´alcoolisme, de prise médicamenteuse particulière ou de cas similaires dans la famille, l´échographie abdominale a objectivé une vésicule biliaire alithiasique avec absence de dilatation des voies biliaires intra et extra hépatiques, la BILI-IRM n´a pas montré également d´obstacle au niveau des voies biliaires avec une vésicule biliaire de morphologie normale sans calculs, le bilan lipidique était normal (triglycérides à 1, 10 g/l, cholestérol total à 1, 12 g/l, cholestérol LDL à 0, 74 g/l), la calcémie corrigée était à 2, 53 mmol/l, le bilan immunologique ainsi que les sérologies virales (HIV, HVA, HVB, HVC, CMV, EBV) étaient négatives. Devant la négativité du bilan étiologique, le diagnostic de pancréatite aigüe idiopathique a été retenu.
Intervention thérapeutique: la prise en charge thérapeutique a comporté l´hospitalisation au service de chirurgie viscérale, l´arrêt d´alimentation entérale remplacée par une alimentation parentérale, une analgésie (paracétamol et néfopam), des antispasmodiques, et des inhibiteurs de la pompe à protons.
Suivi et résultats: l´évolution a été marquée par une amélioration clinico-biologique (SIRS à 0, CRP à 9 et leucocytes à 10850). La patiente a été déclarée sortante 14 jours après son admission.

CR_FRE_285,French,"Il s'agissait d'un garçon de 15 ans, sans antécédent particulier et prenait ses anti-parasitaires irrégulièrement. Il présentait une douleur abdominale de survenue aigue prédominant à la FID, à type de piqûre, intense avec une EVA à 9/10, associée à des vomissements alimentaires, sans trouble du transit ni facteurs déclenchant. Des toux sèches étaient un autre signe associé. Le patient était fébrile, avec une température de 38, 7° le matin. Les examens physiques rapportaient un assez bon état général et un syndrome appendiculaire aigu. On notait un syndrome de condensation pulmonaire basale gauche. La biologie révélait une hyperleucocytose à prédominance polynucléaire et la présence d'oeufs de parasite dans les selles.
L’échographie abdominale par utilisation de sonde superficielle, montrait en coupe transversale une image arrondie, aux contours réguliers, de 7 mm d’épaisseur, à paroi épaisse, hétérogène hypoéchogène et à contenu hétérogène hyperéchogène en coupe longitudinale elle se présentait sous une forme allongée, à extrémité borgne, immobile, et sensible à la compression . Ces images faisaient un souci de diagnostic entre une appendicite et une parasitose intestinale. Finalement, le patient a été traité comme une pneumopathie bactérienne et une parasitose intestinale.","

Elle est multipare ayant allaitée cinq enfants, non fumeuse, sans notion de cancer dans la famille et n'ayant jamais utilisée de contraception hormonale. Elle rapporte l'apparition six mois auparavant d'un nodule de petite taille au niveau du quadrant supero-externe du sein droit douloureux à l'autopalpation dans un contexte d'amaigrissement qui est mis sur le compte d'un auto-régime hypocalorique entrepris par la patiente à cause de son surpoids. La patiente a faussement éliminé le diagnostic de cancer du sein en se basant sur l'absence des facteurs de risque et la douleur du nodule. L'apparition des ulcérations de la peau faisant penser la patiente au zona et traité entant que tel ce qui a retardé d'avantage le diagnostic. L’évolution de la lésion s'est faite d'une façon spectaculaire et rapide dans le temps vers l'extension à la peau avec un amaigrissement cadavérique ce qui a motivé une consultation au service de gynécologie de l'hôpital militaire de la ville de Meknès. L'examen à l'admission objective une patiente d'un teint cireux, cachectique, déshydraté dont l’état général est altéré; pesant 40 kilogrammes avec un amaigrissement chiffré à 36 kilogrammes en six mois. L'examen mammaire révèle un ensemble de lésions nodulaires du sein droit, confluentes ulcérées par endroit, occupant presque la totalité de l'hémi-thorax, auquel elle adhère intimement . L'aire axillaire homolatérale est comblée par un paquet ganglionnaire de six centimètre de grand axe.

CR_FRE_289,French,"Patiente âgée de 66ans, femme au foyer, résidante en milieu rural et ayant un contact avec les chiens. Elle a été opérée pour kyste hydatique du foie il y a 3 ans sans autres antécédents pathologiques. La symptomatologie clinique remonte à 3 ans par l'installation progressive d'un syndrome bronchique fait de toux ramenant des expectorations jaunâtres avec un épisode d'hydatidoptysie associé à des douleurs thoraciques gauches en point de coté et une dyspnée, le tout évoluant dans un contexte de sensations fébriles, sueurs nocturnes et fléchissement de l'état général. L'examen physique a objectivé un syndrome d'épanchement mixte de l'hémithorax gauche et un ictère cutanéomuqueux généralisé. La radiographie du thorax a montré une hyperclarté de tout l'hémithorax gauche avec présence de deux images hydroaériques au niveau du moignon pulmonaire, une réaction pleurale avec refoulement des éléments du médiastin . La TDM thoracique a mis en évidence un hydropneumothorax gauche de grande abondance semblant communiquer avec une image hydroaérique au niveau du moignon pulmonaire associé à une formation liquidienne se projetant à hauteur du médiastin pouvant être en rapport avec un kyste hydatique . La recherche de scolex dans le liquide pleural était négative mais la sérologie hydatique était positive. La TDM abdomino-pelvienne a objectivé de multiples lésions kystiques hépatiques, pancréatique (isthme) et pelvienne en faveur de kystes hydatiques . Le traitement a consisté à une thoracotomie associé au traitement médical. Cependant la patiente est décédée avant l'intervention chirurgicale.","

CR_FRE_290,French,"On rapporte le cas d'une patiente âgée de trente-sept ans, caucasienne, célibataire, sans aucune tare connue, et qui a comme antécédents médicaux une spanioménorrhée depuis un an. Admise dans notre service via les urgences pour un point de côté gauche, une oppression thoracique, dyspnée et fièvre, l'examen clinique a retrouvé un syndrome d'épanchement liquidien au niveau du tiers inférieur du champ pulmonaire gauche, une légère et diffuse sensibilité abdominale et une fièvre à 38°C. Une radiographie du thorax de face a été réalisée et a objectivé une pleurésie gauche de moyenne abondance . On a évoqué essentiellement les étiologies infectieuse et embolique vu la présentation clinique et l'âge de la patiente. Un bilan biologique standard (NFS, ionogramme, crase sanguine, sérologies virales) était normal, le dosage des d-dimères = 4900 ng/ml, un angioscanner thoracique réalisé n'a pas montré d'embolie pulmonaire proximale, son ECG était normal. Une ponction pleurale exploratrice a ramené un liquide jaune citrin, exsudatif (protido-pleurie = 51 g/l), lymphocytaire à 100%, l'examen direct ainsi que la culture étaient négatifs pour les germes usuels et pour mycobactérium tuberculosis, un GeneXpert MTB/rif et le dosage de l'adénosine désaminase dans le liquide pleural étaient négatifs. On a réalisé deux biopsies pleurales à l'aveugle (Trocart de Boutin) et on a recherché la présence de cellules malignes dans le liquide pleural à chaque fois, la biopsie a montré des remaniements inflammatoires chroniques non spécifiques et la recherche de cellules malignes était négative.
Une fibroscopie bronchique a été également réalisée, l'aspect endoscopique était normal, des biopsies bronchiques et une étude cytobactériologique du liquide d'aspiration étaient normales. Considérant la sensibilité abdominale rapportée par la patiente et son antécédent de spanioménorrhée, la négativité du bilan réalisé jusqu'à cet instant, une échographie abdomino-pelvienne demandée a montré une collection pelvienne anéchogène, médiane, bien limitée et contenant des cloisons en son sein, on a complété par une TDM abdomino-pelvienne qui a révélé une masse pelvienne médiane, kystique mesurant 88 mm * 81 mm * 61 mm. Le radiologue a recommandé de compléter encore par une IRM abdomino-pelvienne qui a objectivé une masse pelvienne médiane mesurant 88 mm * 82 mm * 73 mm, un hydro-salpinx gauche et une ascite de faible abondance . La patiente a été transférée au service de gynécologie ou une cœlioscopie diagnostiquée a montré que cette masse prenait naissance au niveau de l'ovaire gauche, une salpingo-ovariectomie gauche a été réalisée, la pièce opératoire était une formation kystique mesurant 70 mm * 55 mm * 45 mm à paroi fine, sans végétations et d'où provenait un liquide jaune citrin . L'étude histo-pathologique de cette pièce opératoire a montré une formation kystique tapissée par un revêtement cubique unistratifié de type séreux régulier, par place abrasé, reposant sur un tissu fibreux vascularisé ponctué de quelques éléments inflammatoires mononuclées, le parenchyme ovarien résiduel était sans particularités, l'aspect morphologique était celui d'un cystadénome séreux . Une radiographie du thorax réalisée quelques jours après la chirurgie, était normale, la pleurésie s'était résolue .","

CR_FRE_291,French,"Après l’obtention du consentement de la patiente et l’accord du comité d’éthique national. Une jeune femme âgée de 25ans, suivie dans notre service pour une scoliose dorsale idiopathique était reçue en consultation d’anesthésie à deux semaines d’une arthrodèse par voie postérieure. L’interrogatoire n’avait décelé aucun antécédent pathologique particulier personnel et familial. L’examen notait un poids à 40kg, une taille de 170cm (IMC= 13, 84) avec un morphotype longiligne. Le bilan infectieux préopératoire ne révélait aucune anomalie (GB=6700, CRP <6mg/l, ECBU normal) et les clichés radiographiques comprenaient un full spine face/profil et des clichés de bending D/G . L’angle de Cobb mesurée était de 56°. Le traitement chirurgical avait consisté à une arthrodèse vertébrale par voie postérieure sur plusieurs étages vertébraux allant de T4 - L2 . L’intervention était réalisée sous anesthésie générale avec intubation orotrachéale par une sonde armée associée à une rachianalgésie à la morphine en raison de 10ug/kg soit 400ug au total. L’induction après administration de 1g de cefuroxime, était faite au propofol, fentanyl et vecuronium et l’entretien par de l’isoflurane et des réinjections de fentanyl et de vecuronium. La technique de l’hypotension artérielle contrôlée (cathéter artériel) avec de l’isoflurane associée à du propofol en administration continue était réalisée jusqu’à la mise en place du matériel. L’arthrodèse était effectuée avec du matériel type SPINEWAY® et mise en place des greffons vertébraux. L’intervention a duré 2h15min et le saignement peropératoire estimé à 500ml. La patiente était restée stable durant l’intervention sans aucun incident ni accident peropératoire. L’analgésie postopératoire était multimodale associant de la kétamine en bolus à l’induction puis en continu jusqu’à j2, du paracétamol 3g/24h, du kétoproféne 100mg/24h. La prévention des nausées vomissement postopératoires et des troubles du transit comprenait du metopimazine, de ladexamethasone et de la trimébutine. La patiente après un séjour en SSPI était transférée en secteur d’hospitalisation le même jour. L’ablation de la sonde naso-gastrique (SNG) était réalisée au réveil en SSPI.L’alimentation liquide et chaude était débutée dès la huitième heure postopératoire. Du premier jour jusqu’au deuxième jour elle présentait plusieurs épisodes de vomissement et un léger ballonnement abdominal. Cette symptomatologie a été mise sous le compte des effets adverses de la morphine dans un premier temps. A j4 les vomissements étaient devenus persistants associés à un abdomen très distendu et douloureux spontanément et à la palpation. Devant la persistance de ces symptômes l’avis des chirurgiens viscéraux a été recueilli permettant la réalisation d’un scanner à J5 et de poser le diagnostic de syndrome de la pince aorto-mésentérique devant des signes d’occlusion haute à type de dilatation majeure de l’estomac associée à une importante stase liquidienne et une réduction de l’angle aorto-mésentérique à 7°.Devant cette dilatation majeure la SNG a été remise en place ramenant ainsi 3000ml de liquide biliaire d’emblée et atténuant considérablement la douleur et la distension abdominale. L’ionogramme sanguin montrait une hyponatrémie à 129 mmol/L et une hypokaliémie à 2, 7mmol/L.
La prise en charge consistait à une mise au repos du tube digestif par diète alimentaire avec mise en place de la SNG en siphonage et l’introduction d’une nutrition parentérale par voie veineuse centrale jugulaire interne. Ce traitement était associé à la correction des troubles ioniques et une analgésie à base d’antispasmodique et de néfopam. Les éléments de surveillance étaient la production liquidienne au niveau de la SNG, la palpation abdominale, le poids et la température corporels, une gazométrie artérielle quotidienne couplée à un ionogramme sanguin et un ASP. L’évolution a été marquée par un échec de la tentative de ré-nutrition orale après ablationde la SNG à J11 avec réapparition des vomissements, de la douleur épigastrique et de la distension abdominale. Ce constat avait motivé un transit aux hydrosolubles réalisé à J13 concluant à un petit passage en aval de l’obstacle au niveau de D3 . L’intervention fut effectuée à J20 après stabilisation des équilibres hydro-électrolytiques et nutritionnels (natrémie à 140mmol/L, potassium à 3, 7mmol/L, gazométrie normale, protidémie à 75g/l). L’acte chirurgical consistait à une dérivation par duodéno-jéjunostomie transmésocolique par une laparotomie médiane sus-ombilicale sous anesthésie générale et transfert en réanimation pour surveillance sur 48h. Après une semaine d’observation en milieu chirurgical d’ou un transit de contrôle avait montré un passage franc du produit de contraste dans le grêle sans fistule digestive, l’alimentation orale fut autorisée sans problème et la sortie décidée à J26 soit trois semaines de séjour hospitalier.","

CR_FRE_292,French,"Madame D.D., âgée de 20 ans, femme au foyer, a consulté dans le service de dermatologie du CHUSS en 2004 pour des ulcérations cutanées, des cicatrices rétractiles et un œdème génital. Les antécédents notaient une cicatrice de BCG et une absence de contage et d'antécédent personnel de tuberculose. Le parcours thérapeutique a duré environ huit ans avec divers traitements anti syphilitique, anti chlamydia. A l'examen, l’état général était relativement conservé avec une notion d'amaigrissement non chiffré et une température à 37°C. La région cervicale, les membres supérieurs étaient le siège d’écrouelles et de cicatrices rétractiles. La cuisse gauche était le siège d'une gomme en voie de ramollissement. On notait un esthiomène de la vulve avec efflorescence de micronodules blanchâtres de tailles variables . Par ailleurs on a observé des adénopathies inguinales et cervicales infra-centimétriques. La sérologie pour le VIH, la sérologie syphilitique, la recherche mycologique et la recherche d'antigènes de chlamydiae étaient négatives. Les radiographies du squelette et du thorax et l’échographie abdominales étaient normales. La culture sur milieux de Lowenstein n'a pas pu être faite pour absence de réactifs et de milieux. L'intradermoréaction (IDR) à la tuberculine était fortement positive (15 mm) et l'histologie a confirmé le diagnostic de tuberculose cutanée en montrant un granulome tuberculoïde avec des cellules géantes (follicule de Koester caractéristique). Le traitement antituberculeux basé sur la quadrithérapie par isoniazide, rifampicine, éthambutol (E) et pyrazinamide (Z) pendant 2 mois, puis l'isoniazide (H) et la rifampicine (R) pendant 4 mois (2 ERH, 4RH), avec le suivi conjoint d'un pneumologue a permis une guérison avec séquelles à types d'esthiomène de la vulve, de lésions atropho-cicatricielles et des brides rétractiles .","

CR_FRE_295,French,"Il s´agit d´une patiente âgée de 57 ans, aux antécédents de fibrillation auriculaire (FA) de découverte récente. Elle a rapportée, l´installation depuis 1 mois d´une dyspnée d´effort d´aggravation progressive associée des gonalgies et des myalgies des membres inférieurs. Devant l´aggravation de sa dyspnée devenant au repos avec l´apparition d´une douleur retro-sternale associée à une toux dans un contexte fébrile, elle a été hospitalisée. A l´examen, elle a été polypnéique à 35 c/min, tachycarde à110b/min avec une saturation en oxygène à (SaO2) à 89%. Des râles crépitants au niveau des bases pulmonaires, avec des œdèmes des membres inférieurs ont été constatés.
A la biologie, un syndrome inflammatoire a été noté avec une protéine C-réactive (CRP) à 48 mg/l et une hyperleucocytose à 15200 c/ml. Le taux des éosinophiles, le bilan rénal, hépatique, les taux de créatine-phospho-kinases(CPK), Lactate déshydrogénase (LDH) et les troponines ont été sans anomalies. La radiographie thoracique a montré la présence des opacités pulmonaires et des réticulations prédominent au niveau des bases et sous pleurale étaient présentes à la radiographie thoracique . Un angioscanner thoracique a été réalisé, éliminant une embolie pulmonaire et montrant des hyperdensités en verre dépoli diffuses au deux champs pulmonaires plus marquée au niveau des bases. Des condensations parenchymateuses pseudo nodulaires bilatérales, épaississement des lignes septales et des bronchectasies par traction .
Devant ce tableau de pneumopathie infiltrante diffuse aiguë (PIA), une origine infectieuse était suspectée en premier lieu et elle a été mise sous antibiothérapie à large spectre associée à une oxygénothérapie (12 l/min). Les hémocultures et les sérologies virales et bactériologiques particulièrement pour les atypiques étaient négatifs. La fibroscopie bronchique a été mal tolérée par la patiente. Les anticorps antinucléaires (AAN), les anticorps anticytoplasme des polynucléaires neutrophiles (ANCA), le facteur rhumatoïde et les anti-CCP (antipeptides cycliques citrullinés) étaient négatifs. Les explorations fonctionnelles respiratoires ont conclu à un syndrome restrictif modéré. L´échographie cardiaque trans-thoracique a été sans anomalies. Devant la suspicion de BOOP post-infectieuse et la gravité du tableau clinique, une corticothérapie à la dose de 1 mg/kg/j a été instaurée. L´évolution a été marquée par une amélioration clinique et radiologique. A la dégression de la corticothérapie à une dose de 20mg de prednisolone, elle a présenté une détresse respiratoire nécessitant son hospitalisation de nouveau. Au scanner thoracique, une accentuation des images en verre dépoli et les épaississements des lignes septales réalisant un aspect de « crazy paving » avec des condensations péri-bronchovasculaires et des réticulations intra-lobaires périphériques a été constatée avec positivité des anticorps anti-antigènes nucléaires solubles de type anti-Jo-1 et Ro52.
Une PID rapidement progressive associée à l´anti-Jo1 a été retenue. Elle a reçu des boli de Solumedrol de 1 g associée à un traitement par cyclophosphamide en bolus mensuel de 1 g. L´évolution a été ainsi favorable avec une nette amélioration clinique et une régression modérée en étendue et en densité de la pneumopathie infiltrante diffuse .","

CR_FRE_297,French,"Enfant de 12 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques notables, qui a présenté 3 mois avant son admission un syndrome d'hypertension intracrânienne fait de céphalées et de troubles visuels, compliqué ultérieurement de troubles de la marche. L'examen initial a retrouvé un patient conscient, apyrétique, ayant un syndrome cérébelleux stato-kinétique. L'examen ophtalmologique a objectivé un œdème papillaire stade III, l'acuité visuelle était réduite à 7/10 à droite et 8/10 à gauche. Une TDM cérébrale avec et sans contraste a été réalisée . Devant l'aspect scannographique typique, le diagnostic retenu était celui d'un kyste hydatique (KH) de la fosse cérébrale postérieure. En effet, l'interrogatoire a retrouvé que l'enfant qui est d'origine rurale était en contact étroit avec les chiens, et qu'il avait un frère de 21 ans opéré il y a 4 ans pour un kyste hydatique hépatique. Cependant, le bilan complémentaire, notamment l'échographie abdominale et la radiographie thoracique, n'a pas montré d'autres localisations associées. De même, la sérologie hydatique était négative. Le patient a été opéré par une voie sous-occipitale médiane. La corticotomie cérébelleuse prudente a permis la découverte d'une lésion kystique à paroi blanchâtre translucide rappelant l'aspect macroscopique d'un kyste hydatique encéphalique. L'extraction en bloc par hydrodissection s'est avérée dangereuse vu la survenue de deux épisodes de bradycardie lors de la tentative d'accouchement du kyste. Ceci nous a amené à réaliser une ponction aspiration première du kyste couplée à un lavage au sérum hypertonique, pour réduire le volume de la lésion avant l'ablation totale de la membrane kystique. Les suites opératoires immédiates étaient simples. La patiente a reçu un traitementmédical à base d'albendazole en postopératoire. Après un recul de 16 mois, l'examen neurologique est sans anomalies et le fond d'œil de contrôle a montré une régression totale de l'œdème papillaire au deuxième mois postopératoire.","

CR_FRE_299,French,"Il s’agit d’une patiente âgée de 64 ans, asthmatique traitée par corticoides inhalés et bronchodilatateurs, ayant un antécédent de tuberculose naso-sinusienne primaire évoquée devant une rhinorrhée purulente et une obstruction nasale avec à la tomodensitométrie (TDM) un comblement des sinus de la face. L’étude histologique des biopsies des lésions de la muqueuse nasales constatées à l’examen (ORL) conclut à des remaniements inflammatoires granulomateux spécifiques évoquant en premier lieu une origine tuberculeuse. L’évolution était favorable sous traitement antibacillaire bien conduit pendant 6 mois et associant l’isoniazide, la rifampicine, la pyrazinamide et l’ethambutol. La patiente n’avait pas d’antécédent de diabète ni de malabsorption. Deux ans après, la patiente présentait une rhinorrhée mucopurulente bilatérale associée à une obstruction nasale avec hyposmie, évoluant dans un contexte d’apyrexie et de conservation de l’état général. La patiente avait reçu plusieurs traitements antibiotiques (amoxicilline - acide clavulanique, macrolides) sans amélioration de la symptomatologie. A son admission, l’examen clinique trouvait une patiente en bon état général et apyrétique. Les aires ganglionnaires étaient libres.
Le bilan biologique notait un syndrome inflammatoire avec une vitesse de sédimentation à 88mm à la 1ère heure, l'hémogramme était normal avec des globules blancs à 6800 éléments/mm3, hémoglobine à 12g/dl, les plaquettes à 350 000 éléments/mm3. L’intradermoréaction à la tuberculine était positive à 15mm. La sérologie VIH était négative. La radiographie du thorax était normale. Le scanner naso-sinusienne montrait un comblement de tous les sinus de la face par un matériel de densité tissulaire, avec une lyse par endroit et soufflure des parois des cellules ethmoïdales, en plus d’une légère déviation de la paroi interne de l’orbite droit refoulant le muscle droit interne. L’endoscopie nasale montrait des sécrétions épaisses provenant du méat moyen avec une muqueuse congestive. Des biopsies ont été réalisées au niveau de la muqueuse nasale et de la région du méat moyen. L’étude histologique du tissu nasal a objectivé la présence d’un processus inflammatoire non spécifique. Une méatotomie avec extraction du matériel intra-sinusien était effectuée. L’étude anatomo-pathologique montre un processus inflammatoire granulomateux, ce processus est fait de follicules épithélio-gigantocellulaires .
Le prélèvement bactériologique du pus à la recherche des bacilles acido-alcolo-résistants est revenue positive à l’examen direct avec isolement d’un Mycobacterium tuberculosis à la culture sur milieu spécifique. Un test de sensibilité était réalisé et n’a pas montré de résistance à l’isoniazide, ethambutol et à la rifampicine. La patiente était mise sous traitement antibacillaire associant isoniazide (300mg/j), rifampicine (600mg/j), ethambutol (1200mg/j) et pyrazinamide (1600mg/j). Un dosage sérique des antibacillaires était réalisé après 10 jours de la prise du traitement. Le protocole comportait un prélèvement sanguin à la 2è et 6è heure pour la rifampicine, à la 3è heure pour l’isoniazide, et à la 2è heure pour la pyrazinamide. Ce dosage avait objectivé un sous dosage en rifampicine à 4, 82mg/l (valeur normale entre 8 et 24mg/l), les résultats de dosage sérique des autres médicaments étaient inclus dans la fourchette thérapeutique. Une supplémentation de 150mg par jour en rifampicine était décidée. Le dosage sérique de contrôle trouvait une valeur de 11, 5mg/l. Le traitement était bien toléré cliniquement et biologiquement avec un bilan hépatique qui est resté normale tout au long du traitement. L’évolution clinique et endoscopique était favorable permettant l’arrêt du traitement à 9 mois. Un suivi de 5 ans n’a pas montré de récidive des symptômes.","

Le patient présente dans ses antécédents une otospongiose opérée en 1990, avec des aphtes buccaux à répétition. L'interrogatoire trouve des épisodes d'hémiparésie à bascule, de trouble de langage, spontanément résolutifs en quelques minutes avec des sensations vertigineuses intermittentes depuis 09 mois.
L'examen clinique trouvait un patient conscient, bien orienté, apyrétique, sans syndrome méningé et avec un examen neurologique sans particularités. L'audiométrie avait objectivé une surdité mixte à prédominance perceptionnelle . Il n'existait, en revanche, pas de signes d'atteinte vestibulaire, avec une vidéonystagmographie sans signes d'atteinte centrale.
L'IRM cérébrale avait objectivé des lésions en plage de la substance blanche bilatérales autour des ventricules latéraux, hyperintenses en séquences pondérés T2 et Flair, avec une prise de contraste leptoméningée, sans image anormale dans la fosse cérébrale postérieure et les nerfs auditifs paraissaient normaux .
Les examens biologiques ont révélé un syndrome inflammatoire et l'ionogramme était sans anomalie notable. La ponction lombaire montrait une méningite à 400 éléments blancs/mm3 à prédominance lymphocytaire, une protéinorrachie élevée à 1, 9g/l, avec une culture négative. Les sérologies du VIH, de la syphilis, des hépatites B et C, de la maladie deLyme ainsi que la sérologie de Wright (brucellose) étaient négatives. Un bilan cardiovasculaire et immunologique s'est révélé également sans anomalie notable. Devant la symptomatologie du patient, sa profession et les résultats de la ponction lombaire, l'ensemble faisant suspecter une neurobrucellose, une autre technique de sérodiagnostic a été réalisée: la réaction de fixation du complément, qui s'est révélée positive dans le sang et le liquide céphalo-rachidien, avec des titres de 1/64 et 1/128 respectivement.
Le diagnostic de la neurobrucellose, type méningo-vascularite, fut retenu et une bithérapie anti-brucellienne associant Doxycycline (200 mg/j) et Ciprofloxacine (500 mg/j) fut initiée et poursuivie pendant 6 mois. Un traitement adjuvent par corticothérapie a été associé durant les 6 premières semaines.

CR_FRE_301,French,"Patient âgé de 67 ans, sans antécédents notables, ayant consulté dans notre formation en Octobre 2012, pour une tumeur du coude droit apparu 6 mois auparavant, et qui a augmenté progressivement de volume. A l'examen, la masse est formé d'un placard nodulaire, de consistance dure, de coloration violacée, saignante au contact d'environ 16 /14 cm avec inflammation périphérique, mobile par rapport au plans sous jacents . Les aires ganglionnaires sont libres. L'analyse anatomopathologique d'une pièce de biopsie parlait d'une tumeur maligne indifférenciée à cellules rondes, et ulcérée en surface. Le diagnostic est confirmé par l’étude immuno-histochimique qui a conclu à un carcinome neuroendocrine malin de Merkel. Le patient a bénéficié, sous anesthésie générale, d'une exérèse chirurgicale large passant latéralement à 3 cm de la tumeur, et en profondeur emportant l'aponévrose musculaire . L'analyse histopathologique de la pièce retrouve les mêmes données de la biopsie et précise que les limites d'exérèses latérales sont saines passées entre 2 cm et 3 cm alors que la limite profonde était rasante. Egalement de nombreux emboles vasculaires étaient présents. A l'examen macroscopique, il s'agit d'une masse tumorale recouverte d'un lambeau cutané de 15/12 cm. A la coupe, il existe une tumeur mesurant 11/8, 5/4, 5 cm d'aspect blanc grisâtre et encéphaloide, parsemée de plages nécrotiques, elle ulcère la peau. En profondeur la tumeur infiltre le muscle. Une radiographie du coude était réalisée dans le cadre du bilan d'extension et qui n'a pas montré de lyse osseuse, ainsi qu'une TDM thoraco- abdomino- pelvienne et une échographie axillaire sans anomalie décelée notamment pas d'adénopathies. Le patient a bénéficié d'une reprise chirurgicale, vu la limite profonde tumorale, et une couverture de la perte de substance (mettant l'os à nu) par un lambeau musculo-cutané du muscle grand dorsal . Après cicatrisation du lambeau, une greffe de peau mince était réalisée au niveau de la face interne du bras et du coude pour couvrir la partie musculaire proximale du lambeau. L’évolution s'est marquée par l'apparition d'une adénopathie axillaire homolatérale mobile d'environ 2 cm de diamètre, 9 mois après le diagnostic de la tumeur. Un curage ganglionnaire axillaire était réalisé avec étude anatomopathologique ayant confirmé l'envahissement ganglionnaire (4 ganglions sur 21 sont positifs). Le patient a bénéficié d'une radiothérapie adjuvante, sur la zone d'exérèse tumorale et la zone du curage axillaire, à raison de 45 séances, avec une surveillance régulière, clinique à la recherche d'une récidive locale, en transit, ganglionnaire ou à distance. L'extension totale du coude était limitée à 160° . La surveillance paraclinique comportait un scanner thoraco- abdomino-pelvien et une IRM du coude droit, qui n'ont pas révélés d'anomalies. Après un recul de 2 ans et 2 mois le patient est toujours vivant sans récidive ni métastase.","

CR_FRE_303,French,"Nourrisson de sexe masculin, âgé de 10 mois, issu d'une grossesse suivie avec accouchement par césarienne et bonne adaptation à la vie extra-utérine a été admis en urgence dans une clinique médicale privée pour fièvre, cris incessants, vomissements, fontanelle antérieure bombée et suspicion de méningite. A l'admission, il était fébrile (38°C), conscient mais hypotonique, pâle, hyperalgique et hypotrophique (6, 8kg). L'hémodynamique périphérique était stable (TA: 100/60, Pouls: 140/min) et la respiration, ample et superficielle. On a noté une légère dyspnée mais pas de cyanose (SaO2: 98%). L'abdomen était souple et aucun signe déficitaire n'a été retenu. Par ailleurs, les antécédents médicaux personnels étaient nombreux chez ce patient, notamment une détresse respiratoire néonatale sur dysostose maxillo-mandibulaire avec division palatine opérée à l'âge de 6 mois, un syndrome dysmorphique facial avec regard particulier, strabisme, base du nez élargi, visage triangulaire, un micropénis, une ectopie testiculaire droite et un testicule gauche minuscule. Par ailleurs, une IRM cérébrale a été effectué à 8 mois et a mis en évidence un élargissement des sillons, des citernes et du système ventriculaire avec diminution de la substance blanche. A noter également, un séjour récent pendant 15 jours dans un cabanon face à la mer. Ses vaccinations étaient à jour selon le calendrier vaccinal marocain: BCG fait à J10 de vie, 3 doses de Pentaxim® et Rotateq®, 2 doses de PCV13 respectivement à 2 mois et demi et 5 mois de vie, 1 dose d'Engérix B®, la 2ème dose reportée du fait de la maladie actuelle. Le bilan biologique a montré une augmentation de la protéine C-réactive (CRP) plasmatique (534mg/L), une anémie (Hémoglobine: 9, 7g/L), une hyperleucocytose (17350/mm3) à polynucléaires neutrophiles (PNN: 88%) et une hypersidérémie (739 μmol/L). Cependant, les plaquettes étaient normales (356000/mm3), les bilans hépatique et rénal normaux ainsi que les échographies abdominales et cardiaques. La radiographie pulmonaire ne montre pas de foyer parenchymateux, ni de pleurésie. La ponction lombaire a révélé des anomalies du liquide céphalo-rachidien (LCR) avec un liquide trouble. La chimie du LCR retrouve une hypoglycorrachie sévère (0.01 g/L) et une hyperprotéinorrachie importante (3, 95g/L). L'examen cytobactériologique du LCR était positif, révélant une augmentation du nombre de leucocytes (282 éléments/mm3) dont 95% de PNN. L'examen direct met en évidence de nombreux cocci à Gram positif en diplocoques capsulés et la culture isole de nombreuses colonies du pneumocoque. La recherche d'antigènes solubles revient positive à Streptococcus pneumoniae. Le Pneumocoque a été identifié selon les techniques standard de bactériologie. La souche bactérienne a été transmise au Laboratoire de Bactériologie, Virologie et Hygiène Hospitalière du Centre Hospitalier Universitaire d'Ibn Rochd, pour sérotypage. Il a été réalisé par la méthode d'agglutination en utilisant le coffret Pneumo-Test-Latex® (Statens Serum Institut) et par la technique de gonflement de la capsule en utilisant des antisérums monovalents spécifiques des sérotypes (Statens Serum Institute antisera, Copenhague Danemark). Il a permis de monter qu'il s'agit d'un sérotype 7A, non contenu dans le PCV13. Le test de sensibilité aux antibiotiques a été réalisé selon les recommandations du CA-SFM-EUCAST. Erythromycine, Tétracycline, Chloramphénicol, Triméthoprime-Sulfaméthoxazole et Amoxicilline sont les antibiotiques testés par méthode de diffusion sur gélose Mueller Hinton additionnée de 5% de sang de mouton. La sensibilité du pneumocoque à la pénicilline G et la ceftriaxone est évaluée par mesure de la concentration minimale inhibitrice (CMI) par E-test. La réalisation de ce dernier à la pénicilline G et à la ceftriaxone a révélé une souche sensible avec un taux respectivement inférieur à 0, 06mg/L et 0.5 mg/L. L'évolution de la méningite est favorable à J4 sous triantibiothérapie IV (amoxicilline+C3G+aminoside): l'examen direct et la culture du LCR reviendront négatifs. Par contre cette évolution va être emmaillée par la suite de plusieurs complications, notamment: 1) une gastro-entérite à Rotavirus d'évolution favorable malgré la vaccination par le Rotateq® (3 doses reçues à 1 mois d'intervalle) ; 2) un syndrome d'hyperthermie majeure; 3) un état de mal convulsif; 4) une détresse respiratoire ayant nécessité une intubation trachéale et une ventilation assistée prolongée; 5) des signes biologiques d'infection bactérienne sévère (hyperleucocytose, thrombopénie, CRP et procalcitonine (PCT) élevées); 6)des désordres ioniques et biologiques importants (CIVD, anémie, hypoprotidémie); 7) une septicémie à Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, sécréteurs de béta-lactamase à spectre élargi (BLSE) et Pseudomonas aeruginosa multi résistants qui ont nécessité de multiples antibiotiques en fonction de la virulence et des différents antibiogrammes retenus notamment vancomycine, imipenème, colistine ou encore ciprofloxacine; 8) une atteinte pulmonaire sévère: atélectasie du poumon droit et foyer de condensation du lobe supérieur droit; 9) des signes d'encéphalite et collection sous durale liquidienne fronto pariétale périphérique gauche à l'IRM avec majoration de la dilatation ventriculaire lors du contrôle 15 jours plus tard. Le nourrisson sort après une longue hospitalisation de 32 jours. Si la méningite à PNO et les différentes septicémies ont guéri aux prix de multiples antibiotiques et si le nourrisson a pu être extubé, le pronostic reste péjoratif du fait du terrain précaire des complications de la méningite à PNO (ventriculite et dilatation ventriculaire) et de l'état respiratoire (atélectasie) nécessitant des soins et une surveillance continue.","

CR_FRE_304,French,"Une femme marocaine de 65 ans a été reçue dans notre cabinet pour une algie linguale chronique évoluant depuis 2 ans. Ces douleurs sont à type de brulure empêchant une bonne alimentation et une hygiène orale correcte. Les traitements institués par d´autres médecins dentistes consistaient essentiellement en une association d´antibiotiques (spiramycine et métronidazole), d´antifongiques ainsi que d´antiseptiques locaux type chlorhexidine ou des bicarbonates en bain de bouche. Ces traitements n´ont permis aucune amélioration notable. L´examen endobuccal a révélé la présence d´une parodontite chronique à un stade avancé et une hygiène orale médiocre. Le tiers antérieur de la langue présente sur les faces dorsale et latérales jusqu´à la pointe une zone atrophique, érythémateuse et bien limitée qui semblait migratrice selon les renseignements de la patiente . L´interrogatoire a révélé que la patiente était diabétique depuis 30 ans et qu´elle utilisait, en plus de l´insuline, le metformine à la dose de 2000mg par jour fractionnée en deux prises et ce depuis 15 ans. En plus des signes buccaux, la patiente présente d´autres symptômes neuropsychiatriques: une insomnie, une irritabilité avec tendance dépressive, une perte d´appétit et une asthénie. La patiente s´expliquait la dégradation de son état psychologique par la période de deuil qu´elle traverse (décès de son conjoint depuis 18 mois). Sur le plan neurologique, la patiente présente des vertiges intermittents même en position allongée, des picotements et des décharges électriques aux extrémités supérieures et des fourmillements aux extrémités inférieures.
Devant ce tableau clinique, une avitaminose B12 a été suspectée et un bilan biologique a été demandé comprenant une numération formule sanguine et un dosage de la vitamine B12 et de l´acide folique sériques. Plusieurs anomalies ont été observées: hémoglobine à 10, 30 g/100ml (N: 12 à 16g/100ml); hématocrite à 32, 90% (N: 35 à 47%); teneur corpusculaire moyenne en hémoglobine (TCMH) à 25, 80pg (N: 27 à 33pg); le volume globulaire moyen (VGM) était normal : 82, 5Âµ3 (N: 80 à 95 Âµ3). La vitamine B12 sérique était très diminuée: 80ng/l (N: 180 à 914ng/l). La vitamine B9 était dans les normes. Les fourchettes de « normalité » indiquées sont celles proposées par le laboratoire ayant réalisé le bilan. D´après ces résultats et vu la normalité du VGM et la diminution de la TCMH (ainsi que de l´hémoglobine et de l´hématocrite), une carence martiale a été suspectée. Un dosage de la ferritine sérique a confirmé ce doute: 5, 62ng/ml (N: 25 à 280ng/ml) En concertation avec le diabétologue traitant ainsi qu´avec un gastro-entérologue, le traitement antidiabétique est maintenu inchangé et la prise en charge de l´anémie a été instituée par un apport de vitamine B12 en intramusculaire (hydroxocobalmine 5000Âµg avec une injection tous les 5 jours) et du fer per os (fer protéinsuccinylate 40mg à raison de 2 prises journalières). L´utilisation prolongée à grande dose du metformine a été retenue comme étiologie provisoire et plausible de la déficience en vitamine B12 en attendant que la patiente se décide à faire d´autres explorations pour éliminer d´autres causes probables. La patiente a été revue en consultation après deux semaines où l´on a noté une disparition complète de la glossite de Hunter ainsi que de la stomatodynie. Les autres symptômes se sont aussi estompés de façon significative.","

CR_FRE_306,French,"Mme I, S âgée de 30 ans, a présenté en mars 2004, dans les suites d'un accouchement de son premier bébé, une polyarthrite fixe touchant les épaules, les coudes, les genoux, les poignets, les métacarpophalangiennes et les interphalangiennes proximales associée à une fièvre chiffrée à 38, 5°C, à une asthénie et à une éruption malaire photosensible. Il n'existait pas de symptomatologie digestive. A la biologie, on trouvait une vitesse de sédimentation à 80 mm à la première heure, une CRP négative, une leucopénie à 2600 cellules/mm3 avec une lymphopénie à 1070E/mm3, une protéinurie à 1, 8 g/24 h sans hématurie ni insuffisance rénale. Les anticorps anti-nucléaires (AAN) étaient positifs à 1/320 avec des anti DNA et des anti Sm positifs. Les anticorps CCP étaient négatifs. Les anticorps cardiolipines étaient positifs. Le complément sérique était bas (C4 à 0, 09g/l et C3 à 0, 52g/l). L’électrocardiogramme, la radiographie pulmonaire et l’échographie cardiaque étaient normaux. La ponction biopsie rénale a conclu à une néphropathie lupique stade II de l'OMS. Au terme de ces examens on retenait le diagnostic de lupus érythémateux systémique et la patiente a été traitée par une corticothérapie à raison de 15mg 15mg/jour de Prednisone et de l'Hydrochloroquine avec une bonne évolution. Ce dernier a été arrêté suite à la survenue d'une urticaire. Un an plu tard, elle a présenté des douleurs abdominales diffuses associées à des diarrhées liquidiennes et à des vomissements dans un contexte fébrile. L'examen clinique trouvait un abdomen souple mais distendu et douloureux sans défense ni contracture. Il n'existait pas d'arthrite, ni de lésion cutanée.
Les examens biologiques montraient une anémie à 9, 1g/dl; une leucopénie à 2900 E/mm3; une VS à 109 mm H1, une CRP négative; des anticorps anti- DNA positifs à 455UI/m, des anti-Sm positifs et un complément sérique bas (CH50, C3 et C4). Les bilans hépatique, pancréatique, rénal et thyroïdien étaient normaux. L'enquête infectieuse (sérologie typhoïde, Shigella, Yersinia, CMV, examen parasitologique des selles et coproculture) était négative. L'Abdomen sans préparation a montré des niveaux hydroaériques. Le scanner abdominal a montré une splénomégalie, une rectite aigue et une distension liquidienne du grêle avec un rehaussement pariétal des anses iléales. La colonoscopie a montré une rectite basse avec à l'histologie une rectite oedémateuse non spécifique. La fibroscopie a conclu à une gastrite. Le transit du grêle a objectivé une atteinte étendue jéjunale avec épaississement et un aspect nodulaire . Le diagnostic d'une entérite lupique a été retenu. La patiente a été traitée par une corticothérapie à raison de 1mg/kg/j entrainant une amélioration clinique avec disparition de la fièvre et des signes digestifs. Cependant à chaque tentative de dégression à une dose inférieure à 30 mg/j de Prednisone, on assistait à une récidive de la même symptomatologie nécessitant l'augmentation des doses voire même le recours à des bolus de Solumédrol de 1g/j pendant 3 jours. En mai 2010, après plusieurs poussées digestives, et alors qu'elle était sous 30 mg/j de prednisone, l'azathioprine a été associé à la dose de 2mg/kg/j. L’évolution était favorable sans récidive des manifestations digestives permettant de diminuer les doses des corticoides . La patiente est actuellement sous 10 mg de corticoïdes sans nouvelle poussée lupique avec un recul de 15 mois.","

L´examen clinique a montré un col aspiré avec disparition des culs de sac vaginaux avec présence d'une lésion de la paroi latérale du vagin saignant au contact de 4 cm. L'IRM a objectivé un processus malin du vagin envahissant le périnée et la branche inférieure du pubis ce qui permet de la classer au stade III. Une biopsie a été réalisée. L’étude histologique de la biopsie de cette masse a montré que le chorion vaginal était le siège d'une prolifération tumorale d'architecture tubulaire . Les lumières étaient comblées par un matériel éosinophile. Les cellules présentaient des atypies modérées et quelques mitoses. Une image d'engainement périnerveux était observée. Devant cet aspect le diagnostic d'adénocarcinome mésonéphrique infiltrant du vagin a été porté. Les cellules tumorales étaient positives pour les anticorps anti-pancytokératine, anti-CD10, anti-CK7, et négatif pour les récepteurs oestrogéniques et progestatifs.

Après plusieurs consultations en cabinet de ville sans résultat, un bilan biologique prescrit au 5e mois de l’évolution objectivait une insuffisance rénale aiguë sévère, motif de son orientation en néphrologie où il est hospitalisé pour des séances d’épuration extrarénale. Une glomérulonéphrite rapidement progressive (GNRP) est fortement évoquée (dégradation brutale de sa fonction rénale, chimie des urines et protéinurie des 24 h pathologiques). Devant la présence d’un essoufflement dans un contexte fébrile, une endocardite infectieuse est suspectée, d’où son transfert en cardiologie. À l’admission, il était altéré, fébrile à 38, 5 °C; le score de Glasgow était à 10/15, la TA à 110/60 mmHg, la fréquence cardiaque à 75 battements/mn et la saturation en oxygène (SaO2) à 95 % en air ambiant. Il présentait une pâleur cutanéo-muqueuse, un purpura pétéchial généralisé, une dyspnée de repos, un souffle d’insuffisance mitrale (IM) de 4/6, une splénomégalie de stade II, une oligo-anurie, une hématurie et une protéinurie (+++). L’échocardiographie transthoracique retrouvait une IM grade III d’apparence ancienne, avec une grosse végétation de 20 mm sur la grande valve mitrale (Fig. ) et une HTAP (PAPS à 44 mmHg). Le ventricule gauche était dilaté, non hypertrophié, hyperkinétique avec une fraction d’éjection à 71 %.

CR_FRE_313,French,"Une femme de 64 ans a consulté il y a environ un an pour une symptomatologie rhinologique faite d'obstruction nasale bilatérale, d'abord intermittente puis devenue progressivement quasi permanente, d'une rhinorrhée antérieure muco-purulente, d’éternuements et d'une épistaxis de faible abondance particulièrement après un mouchage intempestif. Dans les antécédents de la patiente on retrouvait une chirurgie endonasale type méatotomoie moyenne bilatérale (selon le compte rendu opératoire) pour une sinusite maxillaire chronique realisée une année avant la premiere consultation.
L'examen clinique ORL et notamment des fosses nasales trouvait une hypertrophie des cornets inférieurs qui étaient recouverts de secrétions purulente et une perforation antéro-inférieure de la cloison nasale à bords irréguliers contenant des croutes brunâtres et des stigmates de saignement récent 
Cette perforation, apparue chez cette patiente aux antécédents de chirurgie endonasale a d'emblée été liée à un traumatisme chirurgical, en l'absence d'autre cause évidente. Mais la persistance du caractère sale et crouteux des berges de la perforation malgré des traitements antibiotiques et antiseptiques bien menés associés à des lavages quotidiens, nous a poussé à soulever l'hypothèse d'une infection à germes spécifique ou d'une granulomatose et à réaliser des biopsies aux bords de la perforation. L'examen anatomopathologique a montré une muqueuse de type respiratoire reposant sur un chorion où siège de nombreux granulomes épithéloides et giganto-cellulaire avec une nécrose caséeuse.
Le diagnostic de perforation de la cloison nasale d'origine tuberculeuse a été retenu, et la recherche d'autres localisations de tuberculose a été entamée et s'est révélée négative confirmant ainsi le caractère primaire de cette localisation tuberculeuse. La patiente a été adressée au service de pneumophtysiologie où elle a reçu un traitement anti-bacillaire à base d'isoniazide, rifampicine et pyrazinamide pendant 2 mois puis d'isoniazide et de rifampicine pendant 7 mois. L’évolution a été marquée par une nette amélioration clinique et la disparition des épistaxis et de l'aspect crouteux des bords de la perforation, dont le diamètre est resté sensiblement le même .","

CR_FRE_314,French,"Mme T.Z âgée de 77 ans sans antécédents pathologiques notables a consulté pour une tuméfaction douloureuse du deuxième rayon de la main droite évoluant depuis quatre mois avec depuis trois jours apparition de signes inflammatoires locaux. Elle n'a pas présenté par ailleurs aucune autre plainte articulaire ni notion de fièvre ou altération de l’état général. Il n'y avait pas de notion de traumatisme. L'examen a objectivé une ténosynovite du fléchisseur du 2ème doigt droit. Le reste de l'examen ostéo-articulaire, pleuropulmonaire et général était sans particularité. La biologie a révélé un syndrome inflammatoire avec une VS à 40 sans hyperleucocytose. L'intradermo-réaction à la tuberculine était positive à 15mm. La radiographie des mains a montré un épaississement des parties molles du 2ème rayon droit. Il existait par ailleurs une lésion diaphysaire de la 4ème IPP droite, lytique et condensante, cernée d'un fin liseré d'ostéosclérose avec une corticale soufflée compatible avec un chondrome . Une échographie articulaire a montré un épaississement tissulaire associé à un épanchement liquidien siégeant dans la gaine tendineuse des tendons fléchisseurs superficiel et profond du 2ème rayon droit, hyper vascularisée au doppler puissance . Une IRM des mains a été alors pratiquée et a objectivé un épaississement de la gaine synoviale des tendons fléchisseurs superficiel et profond du 2ème rayon droit se rehaussant après injection de Gadolinium. Il s'y associait une collection liquidienne en hypo signal T1 et hyper signal hétérogène en T2 autour du tendon . Par ailleurs, le chondrome du 4ème rayon a été également visualisé. L'indication d'une biopsie chirurgicale a été alors posée et l'examen anatomo-pathologique a révélé un granulome gigantocellulaire mais sans nécrose caséeuse. La recherche de BAAR à partir des fragments prélevés était négative et la culture sur les milieux de Löwenstein-Jensen et Colet était stérile. La radiographie de thorax était sans anomalies ainsi que la recherche de Bacille de koch (BK) dans les crachats et les urines. Devant l’évolution insidieuse, le résultat de l'intradermo-réaction, les données de l'examen anatomo-pathologique et en raison du caractère endémique de la tuberculose dans notre pays, le diagnostic de ténosynovite tuberculeuse a été le plus probable. Ainsi, la patiente a été traitée par isoniazide(INH), rifampicine(RIF), pyrazinamide (PZA) et ethambutol (EMB) pendant deux mois puis par INH et RIF pendant quatre mois. Devant l'importance des nausées et de l'anorexie secondaires à la prise des antituberculeux la patiente a tenue à arrêter le traitement au bout de 6 mois L’évolution a été marquée par une disparition complète de la tuméfaction dès le deuxième mois du traitement avec un recul actuel d'un an.","

CR_FRE_316,French,"Information de la patiente: il s´agissait d´une fillette âgée de 3 ans, admise dans un service de chirurgie pédiatrique à 48 heures de vie. Elle était née d´une grossesse mono fœtale d´évolution normale, au terme de 39 SA; l´accouchement s´était effectué normalement par voie basse, sans notion de réanimation à la naissance. Aucune notion de consanguinité parentale, ni de facteurs tératogènes n´avaient été retrouvées durant la période anténatale. L´enquête n´avait pas retrouvé d´antécédents familiaux d´anomalies congénitales. L´échographie anténatale n´avait pas été faite.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen physique initial objectivait un bon état général, sans détresse respiratoire, un défect pré sternal avec une absence du sternum et le cœur faisant protrusion en dehors de la cage thoracique. La peau en regard du défect était fine atrophique et ulcérée, de forme triangulaire à base cervicale au niveau du thorax, s´étendant de la fourchette sternale à l´ombilic, décrivant un raphé médian en sus-ombilical. Le plateau technique ne permettait pas une prise en charge précoce. Les parents ne disposaient pas non plus d´une assurance maladie. Elle avait alors bénéficié dans un premier temps de pansements dirigés jusqu´à la cicatrisation par une épidémisation progressive aboutissant à la formation d´un tissu cicatriciel fibreux de la peau en regard .
L´évolution a été favorable avec un bon développement psychomoteur. Elle avait été revue et réévaluée à l´âge de 3 ans au décours d´une mission chirurgicale caritative. L´examen physique objectivait: un bon état général, une légère hypotrophie avec un poids de 10, 5kg, une zone cicatricielle dans la région pré sternale avec des mouvements paradoxaux et des battements extra-thoraciques du cœur, un raphé médian sus-ombilicale cicatriciel, un hémangiome de l´hémi-lèvre inférieure gauche . A la palpation on percevait une absence subtotale du sternum.
Démarche diagnostique: la radiographie et le scanner du thorax était en faveur d´une agénésie sternale (manubrium et corps) avec un segment osseux d'environ 2cm au niveau de l´appendice xiphoïde et à hauteur de l´insertion de la 7ecôte ( A et B). L´échocœur n´avait pas identifié une cardiopathie congénitale associée.
Intervention thérapeutique: une thoracoplastie avait été réalisée sous une anesthésie générale avec une intubation orotrachéale. L´incision thoracique était cruciforme centrée sur la région pré sternale. L´exploration chirurgicale avait retrouvé une exocardie partielle du ventricule droit et de l'apex du cœur, une agénésie sternale portant sur le manubrium et le corps avec présence de l´appendice xiphoïde; un péricarde accolé à la peau cicatricielle, aux terminaisons costales et à la face postérieure de l´appendice xiphoïde; un défect ovalaire de la partie antérieure du diaphragme en regard de l´appendice xiphoïde, de 2cm de grand axe . On avait procédé à une dissection et une libération du péricarde des tissus avoisinant, puis à sa fermeture par un sujet continu; renforcé par une plaque de silicone, doublée d´une prothèse de Dura Mater. Le défect diaphragmatique avait été fermé par des points de sutures simples séparés. On avait réalisé une dissection et une mobilisation des muscles pectoraux de part et d´autre de la cage thoracique; puis une ostéosynthèse en forme de pont sur le défect sternal, à l´aide de 2 plaques d´acier fixées de part et d´autre par des fils d´acier aux arcs costaux antérieurs 3, 4 et 5. Les muscles pectoraux étaient rapprochés par des points séparés au-dessus du matériel d´ostéosynthèse ( B et C).
Suivi et résultats: Les suites opératoires ont été marquées par une infection de la plaie opératoire, suivie d´un lâchage des berges mettant à nu la prothèse de Dura Mater dont on avait procédé à l´ablation suivie d´une plastie cutanée en “Z” (3e mois). La survenue d´un rejet tardif de la plaque de silicone au 12e mois avait entraîné son ablation. Les contrôles radiographiques et tomodensitométriques postopératoires étaient normaux .
Après un suivi de 10 ans, la patiente revue était âgée de 13 ans, scolarisée avec un poids de 25kg. Elle présentait un bon état clinique avec une cicatrice légèrement hypertrophique . La radiographie thoracique de contrôle montrait un déplacement secondaire des plaques d´acier.","

CR_FRE_318,French,"Information de la patiente: une patient de 58 ans, sans antécédent pathologique notable, elle est admise en service de radiothérapie pour la prise en charge d´une masse sacro-coccygienne. La symptomatologie évoluait depuis un an sous la forme d´une petite tuméfaction cutanée sacrée, douloureuse, qui a augmenté progressivement de volume et s´est ulcérée par endroit . La patiente n´a aucun signe neurologique ou digestif et elle est en assez bon état général.
Résultats cliniques: l´examen clinique révèle une tuméfaction sacrée mesurant 8 cm sur 5 cm, de consistance molle, douloureuse et fixe par rapport au plan profond. Le toucher rectal objective l´existence d´une masse bombante dans le bas rectum respectant la muqueuse.
Démarche diagnostique: la tomodensitométrie (TDM) et l´imagerie par résonnance magnétique (IRM) confirment qu´il s´agit d´une masse tissulaire de 14 cm de diamètre polylobée, bien limitée, en regard du coccyx, refoulant en avant l´ampoule et le canal rectal, sans signe d´envahissement de ceux-ci. Cette masse est de consistance non graisseuse, se rehaussant après injection intraveineuse de produit de contraste . La biopsie de la masse avec l´étude anatomopathologique et immunohistochimique ont permises de poser le diagnostic du chordome sacrococcygien . La tumeur était chirurgicalement non résécable.
Intervention thérapeutique et suivi: une radiothérapie a été réalisée sur la tumeur à une dose totale de 66 Gy en 33 fractions par radiothérapie conformationnelle. Après 2 ans d´évolution, la patiente est encore vivante avec moins de douleurs et la tumeur est d´aspect clinique et radiologique stable.","

L’examen clinique à l’admission a retrouvé une patiente consciente et stable sur le plan hémodynamique et respiratoire, avec un membre inferieur droit raccourci, déformé en adduction et en rotation externe. Une radiographie de la hanche de face a été réalisée et a objectivé la présence d’une fracture pertrochantérienne du fémur droit avec un large fragment du petit trochanter; en outre elle a montré de multiples images lacunaires disséminées dans les deux fémurs et les os du bassin. Une radiographie du crâne a montré des lésions lacunaires en « emporte-pièces ». Une tomodensitométrie (TDM) du rachis et du bassin a permis une classification précise de la fracture en type IV selon la classification de Jensen-Michaëlsen et 31A2.1 selon la classification de l’AO . La TDM a aussi objectivé l’aspect disséminé des lacunes sur l’ensemble du squelette axial. Le mécanisme non traumatique de la fracture ainsi que les images radiographiques nous ont fait retenir le diagnostic d’une fracture pertrochantérienne instable sur os pathologique. Le myélome multiple a été confirmé sur la présence d’un pic étroit migrant dans la zone des gammaglobulines à l’électrophorèse des protéines sériques, d’une bande monoclonale IgG kappa à l’immunofixation et d’une infiltration plasmocytaire médullaire à 15% au myélogramme. La patiente a été traité chirurgicalement par une ostéosynthèse intramédullaire à foyer fermé de type clou gamma verrouillé avec un montage statique. Les suites post-opératoires ont été normales. La mobilisation précoce à été autorisée, une période de décharge de 4 semaines a été observée sous couvert d’une héparinothérapie de bas poids moléculaire, et un traitement par bisphosphonates a été débuté (acide zoledronique à raison d’une perfusion par mois). La patiente est suivie en coordination avec le service d’hématologie clinique où elle a été mise sous un protocole de chimiothérapie d’induction (bortézomib, thalidomide et dexaméthasone). Après 6 mois, la patiente a été revue en consultation en bon état général et autonome. L’évaluation clinique par la cotation de Postel et Merle d’Aubigné (PMA) a retrouvé un score de 16.

La symptomatologie s’était aggravée, une semaine avant sa consultation, suite à une chute sur la paume de la main droite, coude en valgus et légère extension. Il se présentait avec une impotence fonctionnelle totale du coude droit. L'examen clinique mettait en évidence une attitude de traumatisé du membre supérieur, avec un oedème du coude associé à une prono-supination limitée par la douleur.
La radiographie du coude droit objectivait un foyer de condensation sous chondral avec une ossification irrégulière de la tête radiale faisant un stade 5 selon la classification de Baumgarten .
La tomodensitométrie du coude mettait en évidence des images de defect avec aplatissement de la région sous-chondrale du capitellum huméral. Ce défect est entouré d'une ostéosclérose périphérique mesurant 14 mm de grand axe .
Le traitement a été chirurgical à ciel ouvert par voie d'abord antérolatérale classique avec conservation du ligament collatéral latéral et du ligament annulaire du coude. Nous avons réalisé un avivement de la lésion du capitellum et une extraction de deux corps étrangers cartilagineux libres en intra-articulaire, mesurant respectivement 10 mm et 4 mm de grand axe.

Une échographie abdominale avait objectivé une lésion splénique hypo-échogène d'allure kystique. La sérologie hydatique était en faveur d'une échinococcose (Echinococcus granulosa). C'est dans ce contexte que le patient nous a été adressé pour prise en charge chirurgicale. A l'examen, l’état général était conservé avec des constantes hémodynamiques stables (Température à 37.2°C, Tension artérielle à 130/80 mmHg, Fréquence respiratoire à 18 cycles par minute, Fréquence cardiaque à 65 battements par minute). L'examen abdominal retrouvait un abdomen souple sans masse palpable.
Le bilan pré-thérapeutique biologique (Numération formule sanguine et crase sanguine) montrait une thrombopénie à 88000 plaquettes/mm3. Le scanner abdominal avait permis d'objectiver des lésions liquidiennes spléniques contenant des calcifications faisant évoquer des kystes hydatiques . Une laparotomie réalisée a permis de retrouver à l'exploration des adhérences spléno-pariétales et omento- spléniques, un foie d'allure cirrhotique à surface micro-nodulaire et une rate augmentée de volume polykystique. Le patient a bénéficié d'une splénectomie. Les suites opératoires ont été simples. Une vaccination anti- pneumococcique et anti-méningococcique A et C ont été réalisées en post-opératoire.

CR_FRE_327,French,"Il s'agissait d'un homme âgé de 30 ans transféré d'un centre hospitalier de la place vers le service de médecine interne des Cliniques Universitaires de Lubumbashi (CUL) pour fièvre. Ce transfert a eu lieu après trois jours de traitement sans succès. Au service de médecine interne, une échographie abdominale a été réalisée et avait révélé une dilatation des anses intestinales et un épanchement liquidien abdominal de moyenne abondance. Cette échographie a motivé le transfert du patient vers le service de chirurgie. Ses antécédents étaient non contributifs à sa pathologie. Les plaintes du patient étaient une douleur abdominale permanente avec des paroxysmes, localisée à l'épigastre; vomissement et arrêt des gaz depuis 1 jour. L'examen physique de l'abdomen a révélé: un ballonnement abdominal diffus plus marqué dans la moitié supérieure de l'abdomen; une défense abdominale diffuse; une matité mobilisable dans les deux flancs; et présence des bruits hydro-aériques à l'auscultation. Les orifices inguinaux étaient libres. Le toucher rectal a révélé un cul-de-sac de Douglas non bombant mais sensible. La radiographie de l'abdomen sans préparation n'avait pas été réalisée. Le diagnostic d'occlusion intestinale aigüe a été retenu. Et après le bilan sanguin préopératoire, la visite pré anesthésique et la réanimation préopératoire, une laparotomie exploratrice a été réalisée. L'inventaire des lésions a révélé ce qui suit: 1) un intestin grêle fortement dilaté et un colon ratatiné mais d'aspect normal; 2) un volvulus du grêle à 60cm de valvule de Bauhin. L'intestin a été dévolvulé, et un diverticule de Meckel long de 8cm et 5cm de diamètre a été mis en évidence sur le bord ante mésentérique. C'est autour de ce diverticule que le grêle avait volvulé. La portion de l'intestin volvulé était sphacélé sur une longueur de 5cm . L'acte opératoire a consisté en une résection de la portion sphacélée emportant le diverticule de Meckel suivie d'une anastomose termino-terminale. Les suites postopératoires ont été simples. Sa sortie a été autorisée au 14èmejour. L'examen histo-pathologique du diverticule a montré un tissu fibreux, siège d'une importante réaction inflammatoire, la muqueuse était semblable à celle de la muqueuse gastrique.","

Évaluation diagnostique: l'examen physique a objectivé un flessum douloureux de la hanche droite de 20°, une douleur réveillée par la mobilisation de l'articulation coxofémorale, un indice de masse corporelle (IMC) 32 kg/m2 et un œdème modéré des deux membres inférieurs. Aucun tophus goutteux n'a été détecté. Le bilan radiologique standard du bassin de face et de la hanche droite de face et de profil, a mis en évidence une formation oblongue, faiblement dense, en regard de la face antérieure du col fémoral, suggérant une chondromatose articulaire . La biologie a montré un syndrome inflammatoire, avec des globules blancs à 11000 et une vitesse de sedimentation (VS) accélérée à 120/125. Cependant, le dosage de l´acide urique a été dans les normes. La tomodensitométrie a montré un aspect hyperdense de ces granulations, orientant aussi vers une chondromatose de la hanche . L´IRM a donné l´aspect de multiples formations ovalaires infra centimétriques formant des granulations en hyper signal T2 Fat Sat et hypo signal T1, siégeant au niveau du récessus antéro-supérieur de la cavité articulaire avec un œdème des tissus mous adjacents aux muscles fessiers et à la grosse tubérosité fémorale associé à une distension de la bourse trochantérienne .
Intervention thérapeutique: la patiente a été opérée à ciel ouvert par voie de Hardinge avec exérèse complète d´une formation friable, siégeant sur le versant antérieur de la hanche, suivie d´un lavage abondant de l´articulation et une synovectomie partielle. L´analyse microbiologique du liquide articulaire a été stérile. L´examen anatomopathologique a confirmé le diagnostic de goutte et un traitement médical à base de Colchicine a été instauré. L´évolution a été marquée par une nette amélioration de la mobilité de la hanche avec régression complète du flessum et récupération d´une marche autonome. Toutefois, bien que les douleurs de la hanche aient régressé d´une façon considérable, la patiente a présenté quelques épisodes algiques, très bien jugulés par des antalgiques et des anti-inflammatoires.

L'examen clinique a trouvé une patiente consciente, apyrétique, normotendue à 13/7cmHg, polypnéique, tachycarde à 110 battements par minute avec une désaturation SaO2: 55%, les mollets et cuisses souples. L'examen cardivasculaire a montré un assourdissement des bruits du cœur avec un bruit de galop, et des râles crépitants à l'auscultation pleuro-pulmonaire, sans signes d'insuffisance cardiaque droite. Par ailleurs, l'examen obstétrical, sans particularités, a trouvé une patiente en dehors du travail avec un score de Bishop défavorable. La radiographie pulmonaire a objectivé un syndrome alvéolo-interstitiel bilatéral en ailes de papillon, une silhouette cardiomédiastinale normale faisant évoquer un 35%, œdème aigu du poumon. L'électrocardiogramme a montré une tachycardie sinusale sans troubles de la repolarisation ventriculaire et sans signes d'ischémie myocardique. L'échographie cardiaque transthoracique a objectivé une fraction d'éjection ventriculaire gauche à 35%, sans dyskénésie segmentaire, sans dilatation cavitaire ni d'hypertrophie du myocarde et sans valvulopathies, avec un péricarde sec .
Le bilan biologique a objectivé un syndrome inflammatoire (CRP à 180 mg/l) et une élévation des enzymes cardiaques: troponine: 346ng/L, CPK: 222UI/L. Il s'agit donc d'un œdème aigu du poumon compliquant une insuffisance cardiaque lié à une myocardite virale ou à une cardiomyopathie du péri-partum.

La patiente a donc été mise en position demi-assise, sous ventilation non invasive, diurétiques de l'anse et catécholamines. Avec cependant une aggravation clinique rapide; une désaturation profonde arrivant à 18% justifiant l'indication d'une extraction fœtale en urgence sous anesthésie générale avec intubation et ventillation assistée. La césarienne a permis l'extraction céphalique d'un nouveau-né de sexe masculin, poids de naissance à 2100g, apgar 6/10 passé à 9/10 qui a gardé une détresse respiratoire aigue cotée à 3/10 selon le score de Sylverman améliorée après administration de surfactant. L'évolution clinique maternelle était favorable avec une résolution de l'OAP sur les radiographies pulmonaires de contrôle, et une saturation normale à l'air ambiant après 24 heures d'intubation, elle était consciente, eupnéique et normotendue.

Admise le 25Aout 2010, au service des urgences d'ORL et maxillo-faciales, à l'hôpital 20 Aout de Casablanca, victime d'un AVP, occasionnant un traumatisme facial grave, avec un délabrement important de la face et asphyxie ayant nécessitée une intubation orotrachéale difficile en urgence. La patiente présentait une altération de la conscience avec un score de 13/15 sur l’échelle de Glasgow. Après stabilisation, une TDM crânio-faciale avec des reconstruction 3D a été réalisée. La TDM cérébrale s'est révélée normale. La patiente fut adressée aux urgences ORL et maxillofaciale pour prise en charge. La malade est arrivée chez nous en arrêt respiratoire, certainement due à l'extubation au cours du transfert. Une trachéotomie salvatrice a été réalisée en urgence, devant l'impossibilité de la ré intuber. L'examen physique de la patiente objective un important délabrement des parties molles de la face épargnant seulement la région frontale et palpébrale supérieure . Ouverture des 2 vestibules, et du plancher buccal intéressant les muscles et la muqueuse, désinsertion de la langue et plusieures plaies de la face dorsale. Un Fracas facial qui a inclus: une fracture comminutive du maxillaire, des os propres du nez, du rebord orbitaire inférieure droit, une fracture bifocale de la mandibule avec segment symphysaire mobile occasionnant une glossoptose à l'origine de l'asphyxie. Il y avait des pertes dentaires multiples sur l'arcade inférieure. L'examen ophtalmologique a objectivé un éphéma de l’œil droit.
La TDM faciale avec reconstruction 3D a montré une fracture Le fort I à gauche, un Le fort III à droite avec impaction de l'hémi maxillaire Dt, fracture des 2 apophyses ptérygoïdes, fracture comminutive des os propres du nez, fracture parasymphysaire bifocale de la mandibule détachant la région symphysaire déplacée en bas avec les parties molles, et fracture du plancher de l'orbite droit . La TDM du rachis cervical s'est révélée normale et sous anesthésie générale, après trachéotomie, le traitement a consisté en un parage laborieux: décontamination, extraction des corps étrangers (dents, fragments d'os), excisions des tissus dévitalisés, régularisation des berges des lambeaux. Dans un 2ème temps, une réduction immobilisation des 2 arcades maxillaire et mandibulaire avec mise en place de 2 arcs dentaires a été effectuée. Les sutures ont été réalisées plan par plan sans tension. Les suture des bords du lambeau cutanéo-muqueux au niveau des paupières inférieures était soigneuse sans tension, avec reconstruction des canthus. La muqueuse endobuccale a été suturée, d'abord en réparant les deux vestibules, le plancher buccal, et amarrage de la langue au plancher. La vérification de l'intégrité du sténon s'est révélée normale. La pyramide nasale fut ensuite réamarrée au pourtour de l'orifice piriforme et la columelle fixée à l’épine nasale antérieure sur la ligne médiane, tout en s'assurant de la symétrie des narines. La perméabilité des deux fosses nasales a été vérifiée avec mise en place d'un tamponnement antérieure. la deuxième intervention a été programmée 1 semaine après, jusqu’à fonte des œdèmes, elle a consisté en la reconstruction du massif facial selon le «inside-out, de bas en haut"": durant le 1er temps: une réduction-fixation des fractures mandibulaires a été réalisée à l'aide de 4 miniplaques à quatre trous, après obtention d'un bon articulé stabilisé par un blocage intermaxillaire.
Le 2ème temps a permis la reconstruction de l’étage moyen de la face: réduction et fixation rigide des fractures Lefort grâce à des microplaques, et restauration de l'orifice piriforme. Le rebord orbitaire inférieure a été réparé et fixé à l'aide d'une microplaque, et du fil d'acier. Il n y avait pas d'incarcération musculaire. En fin, une réduction des Os Propres du nez a été réalisée avec mise en place d'un plâtre. L'Evolution a été marquée par la survenue d'un orostome qui a été traité par un lambeau du grand pectoral avec un bon résultat. On a assisté à une nécrose cutanée de la région zygomatique droite qui a té laissée à la cicatrisation dirigée.","

CR_FRE_339,French,"Mlle HOA âgée de 33 ans, sans antécédents pathologiques particuliers, était hospitalisée en août 2000 au Service de Médecine Interne pour une polyarthrite fébrile évoluant depuis 3 mois. L’examen clinique trouvait une fièvre hectique à 39°C et une arthrite touchant les 2 poignets et les 2 genoux. La biologie montrait une VS à 100mm à la 1ère heure, une fibrinémie à 7, 3g/l, une hyperleucocytose à 13400elts/mm3 dont 85% de polynucléaires neutrophiles et une anémie inflammatoire à 9, 6g/dl. La ferritinémie était augmentée à 1445ng/ml. La fonction rénale était normale. La protéinurie de 24 heures était négative. Le sédiment urinaire n’a pas montré d’hématurie. Il existait une choléstase et une cytolyse hépatique. L’enquête infectieuse était négative. Le FR, les AAN, les anti-muscles lisses, les antimitochondriaux et la cryoglobulinémie étaient négatifs. Les radiographies articulaires et du thorax, l’échographie abdominale et cardiaque étaient normales. La ponction sternale était normale. La ponction biopsie hépatique montrait une inflammation non spécifique. Le diagnostic de MSA était retenu et la patiente a été mise sous corticothérapie à 1mg/kg/j entraînant une régression de la fièvre, des signes articulaires et du syndrome inflammatoire. En février 2001, elle présentait la même symptomatologie clinique nécessitant la reprise des corticoïdes et l’adjonction du méthotrexate à la dose de 10mg/semaine entrainant une bonne évolution. En mai 2003, elle était réhospitalisée pour des œdèmes des deux membres inférieurs et du visage. La tension artérielle était à100/60 mmHg. Il n’existait pas de poussée articulaire ni de macroglossie. A la biologie, on trouvait un syndrome néphrotique avec une protéinurie à 8g/24H, une hypo albuminémie à 11g/l et une hypoprotidémie à 44g/l. La fonction rénale était normale (75μmol/l), il n’existe pas d’hématurie ni de leucocyturie. La PBR a permis d’analyser 28 glomérules sans pain à cacheter et a conclu à une amylose. L’immunofluorescence directe était positive pour l’anticorps anti-amyloïde A. Le Méthotrexate était maintenu à une dose hebdomadaire 10 mg, associé à 10 mg/jour de Prednisone. On a associé la Colchicine à la dose de 1mg/jour, un anti-protéinurique et un anti-vitamine K (AVK). En décembre 2004, la patiente était en rémission clinique de sa maladie de Still et on a arrêté le méthotrexate et les AVK. Depuis 2005, elle a annulé la protéinurie. En 2006 et 2010, la patiente a mené 2 grossesses sans aucune complication materno-foetale. Le recul actuel est de 7 ans.","
